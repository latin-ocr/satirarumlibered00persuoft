SATIRA V. 73

Cui licet, ut voluit? licet ut volo vivere: non sum
Liberior Bruto? Mendose colligis, inquit 35
Stoicus hie aurem mordaci lotus aceto:

Haec reliqua accipi03 licet illud et ut volo tolle. γ

Ῑᾶηιῖιὶῗα postquam meus a praetore recessi,

Cur milei non liceat, iussit quodcumque voluntas,

Excepto si quid Masuri rubrica vetavit ἲ 90

ver. 84. ut libuit? 7.

(Arr. Epir-7. 1. 2. 4). Cf. also Diog.
Laer. Zeu. ἔστιν ὴ ἐλευθερία ἐξουσία
αὐτοπραγίας. (St.)

85 Mendose colligis] συλλογίζεις
κακῶς, ‘Your conclusion is faulty,
says our friend the Stoic, his ear
well rinsed with pungent vinegar.
The remainder of your argument I
admit ; to the words lz'c'et and ut
volo I take exception.’

86 mordaci lotus aceto] as in
Sam. 126. Cf. also Plaut. Mil. Glor.
111. 1. 176, and Auson. Ep. lv. 66
Quas tamen explicitis nequeas depren-
dere chartis, Scillite decies non si pur-
geris aceto. The Stoics had a special
reputation for acuteness in detecting
fallacies (cf. Cic. Fam4‚ de Fl'72.111.3)‚
and this use of vinegar may have
been suggested by themselves or their
admirers to account for it.

87 reliqua] sc. the word vivere
(τὸ ζῆν), ⁶ The mere fa& that you are
a living creature I admit : the infer-
ence contained in licet and ut volo 1
altogether deny.' This dissection of
the argument word by word seems
to me more in keeping with the
character of the Stoic than the
sweeping resutation involved in the
ordinary explanation of the words
by which reliqua is understood to
mean the whole of the major premiss
liberum esse cui liceat vivere ut velit ;
for to deny the conclusion in tolo
while admitting the proposition on
which it is based appears to me to
be a clumsy device and unsuited to
the captious Stoic. This latter in-

terpretation however is necessitated
by Macleane's reading Hoc (reliqua
accipio) licet ut volo vivere tolle, and
for this and other reasons I have ac-
cepted without hesitation the far
neater line adopted by Jahn and
Hermann, and supported by the au-
thority of the best MSS. The ordi-
nary explanation proceeds on the fol-
lowing principle: ‘I admit (says the
Stoic) the major and the conclusion:
but the words you repeat from the
major to form your minor ‘licet milei
ut volo’ do not bear the same meaning
in this special case as in the general.
The real Stoic formula always has
in mind a man whose wishes are
such as can be permitted, and a man
with these wishes is permitted to
live as he wishes and is therefore
freer than Brutus. But your nature
is not cultivated and educated: an
outward change only has passed over
you: you therefore cannot be per-
mitted to live as you wish.’

88—w90] The question contained
in these lines establishes the correct-
ness of the Stoic's objecstion as it
proves the man to have no notion os
any other than civil liberty.

88 Vindicta] sc. festuca ; ‘ made
my own master by the stroke of the
lictor’s wand.'

meus] sc. meijuris; αὐτοκράτωρ.
Cf. suijuris, ver. 176.

90 Masuri rubrica] ‘The canon
of Masurius) The allusion is to
Masurius Sabinus, an eminent lawyer‚
who lived in the reigns of Tiberius
