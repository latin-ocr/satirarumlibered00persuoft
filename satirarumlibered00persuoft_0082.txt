54 A. PERsn FLACCI

Hoc, puta, non iustum est, illud male, rectius illud.

Scis etenim iustum gemina suspendere lance 10
Ancipitis librae 5 rectum discernis, ubi inter

Curva subit, vel quum fallit pede regula varo,

Et potis es nigrum vitio praefigere theta.

Quin tu igitur, summa nequiquam pelle decorus,

Ante diem blando caudam iactare popello ’ 15

() puta] like nempe, ‘for in-
stance‚⁷ ‘you see.' Hermann does
not print in itahcs, but its position
in the sentence shows that it is part
of the address supposed to be made
to the populace.

Al. puto, but against the autho-
rity of the MSS, Priscian and Ser-
vius, the former of whom refers to
puta as the reading in this passage.

10] Cf. Alc. Ι. 110C οἴου ἄρα ἐπί-
στασθαι καὶ παῖς ὤν, ὡς ἔοικε, τὰ
δίκαια καὶ ra* ἄδικα. ‘You know,
of a truth, how to weigh virtue
against vice in the two scales of the
faltering balance: you can distin-
guish the straight line when it passes
among curves, or when the carpen-
ter's square is deceptive from the
legs having been bent: and you
can set your black mark against
vice!

These technical illustrations are
clearly derived from the Stoic school,
and the entire passage should be
compared with Sat. 111. 5² sqq. and
Sat. V. ¹05 sqq. A right line is sup-
posed to represent the path of virtue
and cum-ra are the crooked lines of
vice through which it has often to
pass, while the regula is in most cases
a ruler by thc application of which
(as in Sat. V. 38) all divergence from
the straight path may be corrected.
llere however it is used for the
norma, or carpenter⁷s square, which
was· composed os two ngwlae or pedes
joined at right angles. If these be-
came distorted (varus) they would
form no true right angle, and the
instrument would be worthless as a

ide.
ἔῃ13 theta] θ, the initial letter os
θάνατος. It was used (i) by judges
to declare the verdic‘t of condemna-
tion‚ cf. Mart. VII. 37; (ii) in army
lists, Sco. as equivalent to our ‘De-
ceased3’ (iii) by critics and gram-
marians to denote a hopeless passage.
Cf. O multum ante omnes z'nfi’ltlx
littera T heta. (Schol.)

14] At this point the ironical
flattery is dropped: ‘No‚ you can
do none os these things: then why
don’t you leave off this premature
display before a fawning rabble, you
who would do better to swallow
whole Anticyras of undiluted helle·
bore?

15 caudam jactare] like a pea-
cock. The Schol. says Translalio
a canibus, but this would reverse
the position of the parties which is
implied by blanda.

16 Anticyras] For Anticyra as
the emporium of hellebore cf. Ov.
Ep. IV. 3. 53, and, sor the plural, Hor.
Ars Poet. 300 trihus Antion-is capul
insanabile. There were apparently
two places of the name, acl sinum
sllizliacum altera, in Phocide altera
sila. (Jahn.)

meracas] like the plur. Anticyras
(lenotes the violence of the distem-
per, as in Hor. Ep. 11. α. 137 Ex-
pulit helleboro morbum bilemque mc-
mco.

¹7 uncta patena] a ‘rich made
dish! (lm‘la alludes to the sauces
with which it was flavoured; cs.
vx. 69 unge, puer, caules, 111. 102
um‘la pulmentum, and again vr. 16
