SATIRA Ι. 7

Vel duo, vel nemo—Turpe et miserabile—Quare?
Ne mihi Polydamas et Troiades Labeonem
Praetulerint? nugae! non, si quid turbida Roma 5

bles of mankind!
there is in the world! C. Who will

O what vanity

9, sread rubbish like that? P. Is it to

me you make that remark? No one,
of course. C. No one? P. Per-
haps, at the most, two3 perhaps not
one. C. How discreditable and
pitiable! P. Why so? From the
fear lest our Polydamas and his
Trojan ladies should prefer Labeo

to me? Non'sense. No need be-'

cause puzzle-headed Rome dispa-
rages a poem that you should range
yourself with her or adjust the faulty
tongue of your balance by the appli-
cation of her scales; nor, in a word,
look beyond yourself (not, as it is
translated by Macleane and others,
‘ Nor look for yourself in the world
around you' on the analogy I sup-
pose, of such expressions as Γνῶθι
σεαυτόν, and atque aliis de le quam
tu libi, credere noli).

1] This (not line 2, as the Schol.
says) is possibly borrowed from
Lucilius, the Satirist‚ though it is
here made to do duty as the poet’s
own composition. It contains in
itself (as Jahn well remarks) a satire
on the world in general. and may
therefore be regarded as the text or
theme which the poet will proceed
to work out in detail.

2] Hermann's arrangement of this
and the following line appears to
me decidedly preferable to that sug-
gested by Macleane. It gives anima-
tion to the dialogue'⁷ and avoids the
wearisome reiteration nemo hercule,
nemo,· vel duo vel nemo.

3 vel duo, vel nemo] A stronger
form of denial than the Greek ἢ τὶς
ἢ οὐδείς, and, on that account, hardly
to be, compared with it. In the
Latin formula it is the nemo
which is emphatic, in the Greek
the τίς.

4] Cf. Hom. Il. XXII. 100, Πουλυ-

δάμας μοι πρῶτος ἐλεγχείην ἀναθήσει,

and again ver. 105, αἰδέομαι Τρῶας καὶ
Τρωάδας ἑλκεσιπέπλους. The expres-
sion was by this time proverbial (Cf.
Cic. ad Alt. 11. 5, vn. 1, V111. 16).

ne] Sc. turpe est (quia cavendum
est) ne... For similarly condensed
expressions cf. Madvig ad Cic. de
Fin. V. 3, 8 (Jahn).

Polydamas et Troiades] Nero
and his effeminate court. For the
taunt cf. Aen. IX. 617, O vere Pliry-
ιξνίαέ, neque enim Plzrjges! It is
not impossible that the poet intended
a secondary allusion to their boasted
descent from Trojan families. Cf. T ro-
jugenae, JUV. I. 1003 Trossulusver. 82.

Labeonem] He is the Attius
Labeo of ver. 50, and translated the
Iliad and Odyssey into Latin. As
the stock specimen, ὠμὸν βεβρώθοις
Πρίαμον Πριάμοιό τε παῖδας becomes
in his version Crudum manduces
Priamum Priamique pisinnos.

5 Non] for ne, in defiance of the
rule laid down by Quint. Ι. 5. 50.
Cf. Macl. on Hor. Od. Ι. 13, 13,
Pers. Sat. v. 45, and the still more
unusual Disce nec invideas (Sat. 111.
7 3), where no negative has preceded.

turbida] alludes rather to the
confusion of the mind than (as Mac-
leane supposes) to the bustle and
turmoil of the city.

6 examen] sc. exagimen, id quo
quid exigitur vel exacJum fit. This
is one of the technical illustrations so
often resorted to by the Stoics. Other
examples are the Pythagoream T (111.
56), the straight line of virtue and the
crooked lines of vice (IV. 11). Exa-
men and trutina here refer to differ-
ent instruments ⁴ Do not try to cor-
rec‘l the erring tongue of your delicate
balance by applying to it a pair oi
ordinary scales.' Cf. Cic. Or. ΙΙ.
llaec nostra oratio multitudini est ac-
commodanda ad oblefflandos animos,
ad impellendos, ad ea probanda quae
non aurificis statera sea'quaa'ampepu·
