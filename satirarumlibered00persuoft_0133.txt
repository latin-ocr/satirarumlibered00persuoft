SATIRA VI.

Patriciae immeiat vulvae? mihi trama figurae

Sit reliqua, ast illi tremat omento popa venter?

Vende animam lucro, mercare atque excute sollers 75

(i. e. κρόκη) insertum, quod duritiam
utrimque comprimentzls· tramae re-
molliat, sssatlza coire cogatur et jungi,
textrz'cam quoque artem a sapientibus
dixit inventam. (S t.)

74 popa venter] like corvos poe-
tas et poetridas picas (Prol. 13), and
βατράχων κύκνων (Aristoph. Ran.
208). These saerificing priests lived
well on the parts of the victim which
were not required for sacrifice and
which they received as their per-
quisite. Cf. in particular Prop. IV.
3. 62 Succinc‘lique calent ad nova
lucra popae.

75] An abrupt transition from
Luxury toits dire& opposite Α varice,
(cf. Sat. V. ver. 132—153)‚ between
which it is hardly possible to trace
any connection except on the very
unlikely hypothesis that the nepos so
incidentally alluded to in ver. 71 is
really the subjeci: of the satire, and
that the immediate heir, no less than
Persius himself, is expected to save
on his account. But the idea left by
the preceding lines is certainly that
both the heir and the nepos are
persons who would have Persius save
in order that they rnay be able to
enjoy themselves, and men of this
class would be the last in the world
to recognise a taunt so unmistakeably
levelled at the Avarice of luduslly:
Vende animam lucro .· mercare alque
excute sollers Omne latus mundi.
Jahn remarks, ‘ omisso dialogo sen-
tentia de inexplebili avaritia claudit
Satirarn,' and Maeleane, ‘Here he
begins a new branch of the subjetst

which is left unfinished.’ It is to
me an additional proof of the incom-
pleteness of the satire, and after
line 74 a passage in all probability
was to have been introduced which
would gradually have led up to the
subjetf'c of avarice, the climax of
which would have been reached in
the six lines which now close the
Satire. (Cf. Introd.) ‘Sell your
very soul for gain, ply your trade
and ransack with an eye to business
every quaiter of the globe, that no
man may have a cleverer hand for
slapping the stout slaves on the firm
scaffold: double your property. It
is done. Now lzave I made it tlz reffola',
now fomfilld, and now tenjold what
it was: andyet my purse is wrinkled;
set a mark where I'm to stop. Ι
have found yon, Chrysippus, a man
to finish your heap 1²

75 Vende animam lucro] Jahn
well compares a passage from Lon-
ginus, τὸ δ’ ἐκ τοῦ παντὸς κερδαίνειν
ὠνούμεθα τῆς ψυχῆς, and Plut. de colz.
ira 9 ὅτι ’γὰρ α”ν θέλῃ (ὁ θυμὸς) ψυχῆς
ωῘΙΕίΤαί.

excute] Cf. Sat. 1. 493 v. απ
Juv. V1. 143.

77 cappadocas] The slaves of
Cappadocia were as a rule tall and
well-grown (cf. Petron. 63) and in
great requisition at Rome (cf. Juv.
VII. 15), especially for lchicarz'i (ef.
Mart. VI. 77. 43 (jatul. x, 15).

plausisse] is the action of the
dealer to show purchasers the good
condition of the slaves offered for
sale (cf. Petron. 57). For catasta
