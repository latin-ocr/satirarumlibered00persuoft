72 A. PERSII FLACCI

‚Vertigo facit! hic Dama est non tressis agaso,
Vappa lippus et in tenui farragine mendax:

Verterit hunc dominus, momento turbinis exit

Marcus Dama: papae! Marco spondente recusas

Credere tu nummos? Marco sub iudice palles? 80
Marcus dixit: ita est, adsigna, Marce, tabellas.

Haec mera libertas! hoc nobis pilea donant!

An quisquam est alius liber, nisi ducere vitam

czrcumagebatur his verbis: Hunc
hominem liberum esse volo. Quo
fallo praetor, lidore jussu ejus vin-
dic'tam capili servi imponente, Aio
te, dicebat, liberum more Quiritium.

Quiritem] The singular form is
used also by Juv. V111. 47, in defi-
ance of the law laid down by the
grammarians.

76 Dama] a common name for
slaves, and possibly (as Jahn sug-
gests) formed by contraction from
Δημήτριος-

non tressis] like non semissis
lzomo (Vat. Ep. ad Cic. inter fam.
v. 10. 1), and non ego homo trioboli
snm (Plaut. Poen. Ι. 2. 171). In
the present instance the expression
is peculiarly appropriate as the per—
sonal defed‘ts enumerated in the next
line would make him practically
valueless as a slave.

77—81] ‘Stupid and blear-eyed
and dishonest for a paltry seed of
corn. Yet let his master twirl him
round, and by virtue of the twirl he
comes out Marcus Dama. How
grand ! With Marcus as security, do
you decline to lend out money? With
Affarcus on the bench, do you sear
scant justice? lilarcus said so: then
so it is. Pray, Marcus, sign these
‹loeunoentsst

77 vappa] is literally ‘dead wine‘
which has lost its flavour by a second
sermentation (cf. Plin. XIV. 20. 25).
Διόνυσε, πίνεις οἶνον οὐκ ἀνθοσμίαν
(Aristoph. Ranae, 1150) is in all
prohnhility a similar taunt directed

at the insipid jokes made by Dio-
nysus.

lippus] a physical defed’c, or else
the effect of intemperance. Cf. Sat.
11. 72.

78 momento turbinis] literally
‘ by the motion oftlze twirl he comes
out (cf. 1. 45 note) Marcus Dama’ (as
he takes his master’s gentile nomen
and praenomen Asamus Publius, re-
taining at the same time his original
name of Dama).

79 papae] ‘ How grand !’ an ex-
clamation of affected admiration,
certainly not of disgnst, which inter-
rupts the fine irony of the passage
and is inconsistent with the tone of
what follows.

80 sub judice] a proof that he
has become an eques.

81 tabelias] is any business do-
cument, and need not be restrieted
to the sense of testamenlmn.

82 mera] sc. Liberty 1⁷71 tlze bare
sense oftlze word. For pilea cf. note
on Sat. 111. 106.

84] The syllogism which follows
is not propounded by Marcus, as
some editors have supposed, who is
only introduced to point the moral
of the scw last lines, but rather by
some casual sceptic‚ it may be by
the same person who raised the ori-
ginal objecffion Cras lmeficl in ver.
66. It shows considerable skill, as
for thc major premiss he takes the
genuine (lefinition os liberty cst pe
testas vivendi ut velis (Cic. Pamd. v)
ἐλεύθερός ἐστιν ὁ ζῶν ὡς βούλεται
