sATIRA 1. 9

Grande aliquid, quod pulmo animae praelargus anhelet 3
Scilicet haec populo pexusque togaque recenti 15
Et natalicia tandem curn sardonyche albus

Sede ,leges celsa, liquido quum plasmate guttur

M‘obile collueris, patranti fractus ocello.

Hic neque more probo videas nec voce serena

Ingentes trepidare Titos, quum carmina lumbum 20

Intrant, et tremulo scalpuntur ubi intima versu.
ve1·.19. sonora Ὑ,

‘Do pray permit me ; 1 would rather
not do it, yet how ean Ι help myself ‘2
but I am ...... ⁷

12 Quid. faciam‘2] We must sup-
ply after faciam something to this
effect, ‘I would gladly oblz'ge you,
but the sacst is I arn carried away by
my satirica] humour.'

splene] Laughter was assigned
to the spleen, as anger to the gall,
love to the lz'ver.

cachinno] For this substantive
form cf. gluto (V. 112.) from glutus,
popina from popina, ganeo from ga-
nea.

13—30] All write with a view to
public recitation and applause.

13 inclusi] ‘ boxed up in our
studies.' Why Macleane should alter
inclusi to inclusus and yet translate
as if he read inclusi I cannot con-
ceive. The alteration destroys the
balance of the sentence, which is
improved on the contrary by the very
graceful emendation inclusus numeris
mentioned to me by Mr. Paley, ⁴ We
all of us write, one hampered by
metre, another unfettered by such
restriction.' In either case numeros
and pede are here identical in
meaning.

14 Grande aliquid] ‘something
grand to be spouted by the lungs
most lavish of breath.' For anhelet
in this sense cf. Quint. XI. 3. Sunt
qui crebro anhelitu imitentur jumenta
onere et jugo laborantia.

15 scilicet] ‘for of course you
intend this for the people.' Scilicet
denotes the thought in the compo-

ser’s mind rather than the irony of
Persius at the character of the poenis,

pexus] ‘with hair well combed,
and toga fresh from the fuller's hands,
and the birthday ring at last upon
your finger.'

16 tandem] when the great day
has at last corne round.

17 leges] legens aL, which is sup-
ported by nearly all the Mss; leget
Macl. I had retained legens with
Jahn and Herm. as giving greater
definiteness to the imaginary scene,
and as more likely to have been
altered than the easier readings leges,
leget. Yet leges is far better Latin,
while es and &s are constantly inter-
changed in the MSS.

plasmate] probably a gargle for
clearing the voice, although in the
passage from Quint. (1. 8), which
Macleane, quotes in support of this
interpretation it seems rather to
mean an affected modulation of
the voice than a gargle: Sit lenio
non in canticum dissoluta nec plas-
mate, nt nunc a plerisque fit, effi’-
minata. Cf. Plut. vit. Brut. 34, εἰσ-
ῆλθε μετὰ πλάσματος φωνῆς ἔπη πε-
βαίνων.

18] ‘glinting the while with wan-
ton eye.'

20 trepidare] ‘fidget.⁷

Ingentes Titos] Ironical. Cf.
Celsi Rhamnes (Hor. Α. P. 342).
Titos is here put for Titienses (one
of the three centuries of equites
formed by Romulus), and so for the
aristocracy of Rome. (Macl.).

21 ubi] Ut Heinrich. although
