PROLOGUS.

THIS short poem or ‘prologue’ (as it is styled by the grammarians) is
generally supposed to have been written by Persius as an Introduction to
one or more of the Satires. Short and simple as it is, we shall nevertheless
find no small difficulty in determining its import and relation to the satires
to which it is prefixed. In the first place it contains two statements
which are direc'tly at variance with what we know of Persius from other
sources, for it speaks of him as semi-paganus (‘half-educated') and suggetis·
that he wrote for pay, whereas our best authority for the life of Persrus
expressly states that he was a ‘ wealthy Roman EqueS, connetsted by blood
and marriage with men of the highest rank-³

Let us notice briefly the attempts which have been made to explain the
apparent discrepancy. It is certainly possible that ‘semi-paganus' may
refer solely to his education as poet (cf. Catul. Carm. XXII„ more especially
the line Idem inficeto est inficetior rure) but, taking this for granted, the
second and more inexplicable imputation of poverty remains to be ac-
counted for.

(i) Macleane suggests that ‘ the verses are no more than an apology for
his presumption in presenting his offering to the Muses’—which may very
possibly be true: that ‘the lines have the appearance of a fragment’-—an
entirely gratuitous supposition‚ and unsupported, so far as I can discover, by
the slightest evidence: that the allusions to rusticity and want ‘ can only
have ,been intended for a joke‘—an idea utterly irreconcileable with what we
know of the character of Persius, unless an adequate motive can be assigned
for the misrepresentation.

(ii) Jahn thinks the difficulty may be solved by supposing that Persius
identifies himself for the time being with the mercenary poets whom he
afterwards exposes in the first Satire. He consequently regards the poem
