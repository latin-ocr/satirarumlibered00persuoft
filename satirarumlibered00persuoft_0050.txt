22 A. PERSII FLA'c‘c1 SATIRA 1.

His mane edietum, post prandia Calliroen do.

¹34 edictum] The play-bill, post-
ed up by the praetor, and containing
a programme of the day’s amuse-
ments (Jahn).

prandia] loosely for coena (Macl.
but wrongly, for it would then be
too late for the auditorium to which
they repaired after lanchem).

caJnroenJ2 -Not a nonaria, as
Maeleane suggests. Persius would be

the last person to give such advice
even in jest. He means a poem of
the Phyllis and Hypsipyle class, no-
ticed in ver. 34. This is the explana·
tion of the Schol. who adds, Calli-
rhoe nympha fuit quam Paris ante
raptum H‘elenae habuit, quae deserta
multum dzkz‘tur rupti amoris dulce
flevisse consortium.
