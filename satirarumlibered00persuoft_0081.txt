SATIRA IV. 5 3

Dicere, sorbitio tollit quern dira cicutae—

Quo fretus? die o magni pupille Pericli.

Scilicet ingenium et rerum prudentia velox

Ante pilos venit, dicenda tacendaque calles. , 5
Ergo ubi commota fervet plebecula bile,

Fert animus calidae secisse silentia turbae

Maiestate manus.

Quid deinde loquere? Quirites,

ver. 3. hoc Mp. Herm. Koenig 3 o Bt. Jahn, Macl.

ver. 5. tacendave γ.

ward of the mighty Pericles. You
would have us believe that intellec}
and a keen eye to forecast events
have come to you before your beard z
that you know when to speak and
when to forbear.'

1 Rem populi tractas] Cf. Plat.
Alc. 1. 1188 Διὸ καὶ ἄττεις πρὸς τὰ
πολιτικαὶ πρὶν παιδευθῆναι.

2 touit] the historic present. Cf.
Madv. ξ 336, Obs. 1. The whole
passage here refers to a past scene,
supposed to be repeating itself in
present time. Jahn explains the
use as justifiable, ubi per pronomen
relativum explicationis gralia rei
praeteritae mentio breviter ocfficilmn

3 Quo fretus] τί οὖν ποτ’ ἔστιν
ὅτῳ πιστεύει τὸ μειράκιον; Alc. Ι.
12 3 E.

pupille Pericli] His father Clinias
was killed at Comueia, B.C. 447,
and lest Alcibiades under the care
of Pericles and Ariphron‚ who were
second cousins of his mother Dino-
mache. Cf. Corn. Nep. 11. 1. 1.

Pericli] or uncontr. Pem'clei from
nom. Periclem, like Ulixei, Achil-
lei, &a

4 prudentia velox] like ὴ πρόνοια
αὑτοῦ ἡ ἐς τὸν πόλεμον (Thue. 11. 65).
Velox can hardly mean ‘precocious‚'
which is the explanation of the
Schol.

5 Ante pilos] for Nero was em-
peror before he was 17. Cf. Suet.
Ner. 8, Tac. Anu. ΧΙΙΙ. 1. 6.

dicenda tacendaque] is usually
equivalent to the Gk. ῥηταί τε καὶ
οἴῤῥητα in the sense of ‘all possible
subjeets‚’ cf. Hor. Ep. 1. 7. 72 dicen-
da tacenda locutus, but⁴its meaning
in the present passage is better ex-
emplified in Quint. 11. 20. 5, si con-
sonare sibi in faciemlz's ac non facien-
‹ll's vinulis est, quae pars ejus pru—
dctm'a vocalm‘, cadem in dicende& ac
noll dz'cetzdtlr erit!

6 Ergo] ‘Accordingly,‘ sc. be-
cause you are so conscious of your
powers.

plebecula] the ‘ rabble;' con-
temptuously‚ as in Cic. ad Att. Ι. 16.
1 1 misera ac jqjuna plebecula.

7] ‘ Suppose the spirit moves you
to impose silence on the heated
throng by a majestic wave of the
hand! Cf. Διανοεῖ ’γὰρ παριέναι συμ-
βουλεύσων Ἀθηναίοις ἐντὸς οὐ πολ-
λοῦ χρόνου, Alc. Ι. 106 C.

8 Quid. deinde loquere ‘.¹] The irony
of this and the next line is twosold,
and exposes (i) the oratorical inca-
pacity (lisplayed in the bald asser-
imus, semlant, male, 7·ec‘t’z‘1ss,· (ii) the
arrogance of the man who dictatos
thus peremptorily on subjects of
which he knows nothing. So in
the Alc. 113ss οὐκοῦν ἐλέγχθη ὅτι
περὶ δικαίων καὶ ἀδίκων Ἀλκιβιάδης
ὀ καλὸς ὀ Κλεινίου οὐκ ἐπίσταιτο,
οἴοιτο δέ, καὶ μέλλοι είς ἐκκλησίαν
ἐλθὼν συμβουλεύσειν Ἀθηναίοις περὶ
ὧν οὐδὲν οἶδεν,·
