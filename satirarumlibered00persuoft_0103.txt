SATIRA v. 75

Publica lex hominum naturaque continet hoc fas,
Ut teneat vetitos inscitia debilis ac'tus.

Nescius examen? vetat hoc natura medendi:

interpretation, and it is unquestion-
ably more forcible as it makes the
man’s own authorities decide against
him. Macleane strangely enough
regards these lines as addressed to
the magistrate of ver. 33, who was
only introduced incidentally and
never became a party in the dia-
logue.

97 vitiabit agendo] ‘will spoil
in the doing,' quia non novit (Jahn).

98 Publica lex hominum] sc. the
universal laws of mankind. Cf.
Prop. 1V. 11. 47 Mi natura dedit
leges a sanguine ducias. These are
the d'7pa7rra νόμιμα of Sophocles,
the οἷ’γραφοι νόμοι of Thucydides,
ὅσοι ἄγραφοι ὄντες αἰσχύνην ὁμολο-
γουμένην φέρουσι (II. 37). Natura
Ι understand as almost equivalent
to ratio above.

99 teneat vetitos] ‘should hold
in abeyanee arfts which nature has
forbidden,' because, as Jahn well

Tibi recto vivere talo

a clodhopping ploughman were to
claim the command of a ship‚ Meli-
certa would protest that all sense of
shame had perished from amongst
us.'

compescere] is ‘ to bring the
tongue of the steelyard to a state of
rest⁷ by adjusting the weight in the
notches till the examen becomes pa-
rallel with the ansa. “

The parts of the steelyard (statera)
are scapus (the bearn), aequipondium
(the weight or counterpoise which
moves along it), examen (the tongue
by which the instrument is regu-
lated). In the present passage Mac—
leane consounds the examen with the
aequipondium, and refers compescere
to the latter instead of to the former
portion of the instrument.

102 peronatus] the pero was a
thick boot of untanned hide. Cf.
Virg. Aen. VII. 690, and Juv. XIV.
186 Quem non pudet allo Per glaciem

remarks, quodcunque inscitia agit, id perone tegi qui summovet Euros Pel -

vetitum est. Cf. Hor. Carni. 1. 3.
25 Audax omnia perpeti Gens liu-
mana ruit per vetitum nefas. Others
make ac't’us stand alone, and trans-
late teneat vetitos ‘ should regard as
forbidden.'

100] Persius proceeds to enforce
the truth of his position by two
examples derived from Hor. Ep. ΙΙ.
ι. 114 Navem agere ignarus navis
timet ‚· abrotonum aegro Νονι audet

isi qui didicit dare. Translate: ‘Do
you mix hellebore when you cannot
adjust the tongue of the steelyard
at a given point? The very nature

of medicine forbids the notion. If

libus inversis.

103 Melicerta] a name sor Pa-
laemon son of Ino (cf. Inoo Meli-
certae, Virg.) and apparently iden-
tical with Portunus, the protetfting
god of harbours.

perisse frontem] Cf. cute perditus
(Sat. Ι. 23), populisronsdnrior(Juv.
VIII. 189) and, in particular, Juv.
XIII. 242 Quando recepit Ejecslnm
semel attrita de fronte pudorem ? and
Hor. Ep. 11. 1. 80 Clament pem'sse
pudorem C 2172ch paene patres.

104 recto vivere talo] ‘to walk
uprightly' like reae stetfizbula talo
(Hor. Ep. 11. 1. 176). Cf. the cor-
