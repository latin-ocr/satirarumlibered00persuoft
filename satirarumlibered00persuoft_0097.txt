SATIRA V.

Rugosum piper et pallentis grana cumini, 55
Hic satur irriguo mavult turgescere somno 3

Hic campo indulget3 hunc alea decoquit3 ille

In Venerem putris 3 sed quum lapidosa cheragra

Fregerit articulos, veteris ramalia fagi, ⁷

Tunc crassos transisse dies lucemque palustrem 60
Et sibi iam seri vitam ingemuere relidiam.

At te noCturnis iuvat impallescere chartis;

Cultor enirn iuvenum purgatas inseris aures

lta certe jerunt Porcii Latmus, clari
inter magistros dicendi, affi‘c‘tatores
similitudinem coloris studiis contradi
imitatos. But it was also used as a
substitute for pepper, and is men-
tioned by Pliny (XIX. 8. 47) as
condimentum fastidiis- amicissimum
( ahn).
J 56 satur turgescere] to ‘live well
and grow fat.² lrriguo is probably
nothing more than the ordinary
poetic epithet (like θαλερῷ ‘ refresh-
ing’ sleep), cf. fessos sopor irrigat
artus, though Macleane instances
lrrzgrunmqne mero suh noc‘tem corpus
habento (Hor. Sat. 11. 1. 9) and
explains it here of a drunkcu sleep,
in which case obesus somnus (Sulp.
56) would be a somewhat analogous
expression.

57 campo] sc. campestri exercita-
tione (Suet. Aug. 83).

decoquit] coquendo vires absumit
(Jahn). In its original no less than
in its derived sense decoquere may be
compared with despumare (111. 3) as
the primary sense of both words is
connetfted with the boiling down of
‘must' into sapa or chjfrutum (cf.
decoffius 1. 125), and both are used
figuratively of anger (ef. note on ΙΙΙ.
3, and Claud. iu Eutrop. 11. 349
accensam sed qui [mne decoquat iram).

58 lapidosa] Cf. ‘nodosa cheragra'
(Hor. Ep. 1. 1. 31) and postquam illi
justa cheragra Contudit articulos (Sat.
11. 7. 15) as passages Which Persius
has imitated in these lines.

59 ramalia] ‘like the boughs of
an old beech-tree,’ an expression
which may be compared with 1. 97
Ut ramale vetus praegrandi subere
cottum. Mr Paley has suggested
to rne that φηγός and fagus are pro-
bably identical‚ and represent the
edible acorn tree (quercus aescula)
rather than the beech as the latter
word is ordinarily translated.

60 lucemque palustrem]
fruetuosam, quod audac‘ter a solo ad
lucem transtulit' (Jahn), an expla-
nation in which I venture to think
few persons will acquiesce. It has
always seemed to me possible that
by lucem palustrem might be meant
‘the false marsh light (iguis fatuus)
they have been following‚’ and I see
that Stocker suggests the sarne inter-
pretation. If this is thought fancisul,
we may readily explain it of the
⁶ marsh vapours which dim the light
of lise‚' sor, as Macleane remarks,
‘Crassos dies and lucem palustrem
express very well the dull unwhole-
some atmosphere in which alife os
idleness and sels-indulgence 15 spent.'

61] So Tibullus Ι. 4. 33 Vidi ego
jam juvenem, premeret cum serior
aetas, Aloerentem stultos praeteriisse
dics.

62 impallescere] like invigilat
(Sat. 111. 55).

63 purgatas] a metaphor from
husbandry‚ Translatus ab agro co-
lendo qui primum purgatur ab herbis
sterilibus et noxiis, deiude inseritur
