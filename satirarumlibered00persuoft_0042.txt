14 A. PERsn FLACCI

Occipiti caeco, posticae occurrite sannae!

Quis populi sermo est? quis enirn, nisi carmina molli
Nunc demum numero fluere, ut per leve severos
Effundat iunctura ungues? Scit tendere versum 65
Non secus ac si oculo rubricam dirigat uno 3
Sive opus in mores, in luxum, in prandia regum
Dicere, res grandes nostro dat Musa poetae.

Ecce modo heroas sensus afferre videmus

hound.' Cf. siticulosa Apulia, Hor.
Epod. ΙΙΙ. 16; and, for the construc-
tion, Luc. 1. 259 Quantum νιινα
silent, tanta quies.

62 occipiti caeco] ‘without eyes
in the back of your head!

occurrite] ⁶ Turn round and face
the sneer behind you,’ or else (as in
ΙΙΙ. 64) ‘take measures to prevent
it,' sc, by ceasing to publish.

63—68] ‘ ‘But what do the people
say of me‘2' Why what would you
expect but this, ‘that verses have at
last begun to flow in easy rhythm,
5ο that the join allows the critical
nail to pass smoothly over its even
surface; our poet knows how to
shape a verse as truly as if he were
guiding the red line with one eye
closed '2'

63 qujs enim] Why what would
you expect when your position en-
ables you to command applause?
(Cf. note on v. 8.)

65 effundat] The metaphor is
taken from the sculptor, who runs
his nail over the marble to test the
accuracy of the joining. Cf. velata
quum crystallinas crustas aut any-
cltilinas non impasto dlssgrl'ms ungue
perlabilur, Sidon. Apoll. IX. 7, Hor.
Sat. Ι. 5. 32; Ars Poet. 294 (St.).

junctura] The word occurs again
in ver. 92, and refers probably to
the patchwork poetry improvised
after dinner on old and standard sul,-
36615. (Cf. ver. 32.) The imitation os
Catul. Carm. LXIV. in ver. 99—-102 is
a cento of this kind, and, judging from
the context of the passage, was pro-

bably considered a good specimen of
‘resetting.' Casaubon, following the
Scholiast on ver. 99, ascribes these
verses to Nero himself, who certain-
ly wrote a poem entitled the Bacchae.
Cf. ἐκιθαρῴδησέ τε ’Άττιν τινὰ ἦ
ΒάὙχας ὁ Αὔγουστος (Dion Cass.
LXI. 20).

66 rubricam] φοῖνιξ κανών, Eur.
Herc. Fur. 945.

67 sive] not (as Macl.) in oppo-
sition to what precedes, for nothing
has gone before to which it can be
opposed, but in relation to what
follows. ⁶ Should the occasion, ever
require him to inveigh against the
morals, the luxury, or the entertain-
ments of the rich, the Muse gives
high sounding subjects to our poet.'
The rhythm of the line, no less than
the absence of all cono-ast, suggests
that mores and luxum, as well as

prandz'a, are to be joined with regum.

In either case notice the descent
from the ‘general' to the ‘particu-
lar.' For this use of sive ef. Prop.
ΙΙ. 26. 29 Seu mare per longum mea
fugitet ire puella, Ηαπῑ sequar. His
igitur locis una quaedam res prae
caeteris videtur efferenda. . quare sive
ita adhibitum videtur ut vel. (Jahn.)

68 grandes] Whatever the sub-
je& may be, he makes it bombastic.

69——71] ‘We see now-a-(lays men
bringing to their task heroic senti-
ments on the strength of having
trifled a little in Greek, men who
lack the skill to depic‘t 3 wood or to
praise the fertile country.'

69 modo] Macleane would trans·
