62 A. PERSII FLACCI

Centum ora et linguas optare in carmina centum,

Fabula seu moesto ponatur hianda· tragoedo,

Vulnera seu Parthi ducentis ab inguine ferrum.—
Quorsum haec? aut quantas robusti carminis offas 5
Ingeris, ut par sit centeno gutture niti?

Grande locuturi nebulas Helicone legunto,

ΥΕΓ. 2 .

commended the mother of Persius
to destroy all his earlier composi-
tions.

1—4] is the soliloquy of Persius
‘ O that Ι had a hundred tongues ἔ ’

1 vatibus] vates, as previously no-
ticed on ver. 7 of the Prologue, is a
more honourable term than pocta.
We may gather this from its ironical
use in Juv. Ι. 19, Stulta cst clementia,
quum tot ubique Vatibus occmras,
periturae parcere chartae.

centum voces] Two examples out
of many will suffice, Hom. ll. ΙΙ.
489, οὐδ’ εἴ μοι δέκα μὲν ’γλῶσσαι
δέκα δὲ στόματ’ εἶεν Φωνὴ δ’ ἄῤῥη-
κτος χάλκεον δέ μοι ἦτορ ἐνείη, aud
Virg. Aen. V1. 625, Νοιι milti si
linguae centnm sint, umque centum,
Ferrea vox, omnes scelermn compren-
dere formas, Omnia poenarum per-
currere nomina possim.

3 ponatur] like ponere lucum (Ι.

7) posuisse figuras( (L 86). But
two other explanations are admis-
sible (1) to ‘serve up‚’ cf. calidum
scis ponere sumen (1. 5 3), which is
in good keeping with remanda 111
ver. 95 and (ii) to ‘produce’ in the
sense of the Greek διδάσκειν τραγῳ-
δίαν.

manda] ‘ To be spouted by some
‹lolesul atstor) Hiana'a has rescr-
ence to the tragic mask, in which a
wide aperture was cut sor the mouth
to facilitate a distin& enunciation.
From the appearance presented by
the speaker it soon came to be used
of a bombastie style of utterance.
Cf. carmen hiare (l'rop. ΙΙ. 31. 6),
and grande Sophocleo carmen baccha-

carml'ne γ.

mur hiatu (Juv. VI. 636).

4 Vulnera Parthi] ‘ The wounds
dealt by the Parthian who draws
the arrow from his side.' Cf. szlen-
temque sitga Parthum versatque sa-
gittis (Virg. Gemg. ΙΙΙ. 31). So Jahn
and Casanbon, and also Heinrich
who however wrongly understands
ftrrum to mean the [Medus acinaces
or scimitar. This is in all proba-
bility the right explanation of the
line, for, as Jahn well remarks, the
Greeks wore the quiver from the
shoulder so that the mention of its
position in this lace serves to give
rleality to the piepture. Mol eover in
the passage quoted above from Vir-
gil' s Geoa gl'ffis which occurs in direct
connection with the arrangements
of the theatre‚ the word venes sug-
gests by implication that the fio gmes
of the Parthian archers were com-
monly represented in this very atti-
tude.

The other interpretation which
explains it os a ‘wounded Parthian
drawing the arrow from his groin’
is too general to suit a passage where
a definite picture is required, though
it is certainly strongly supported by
the line which the Schol. quotes
from Hor. Sat. 11. 1. 15, aut labentis
equo describat vulnera Rzrtlzi.

5] ‘WVhat’s the meaning of all
this? What huge morsels of lusty
song are you trying to swallow that
you should need a hundred throats
sor the essort? Let those who study
bombast go gather clouds on Heli-
con, is they wish to boil anew the
potos Progne or Thyestes to be
