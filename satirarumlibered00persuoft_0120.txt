3 Mire opifex] may be a sub-
stantive or an ,adjective but more
probably the latter, cf. artzsex sequi
(prol. ver. 11). I have followed
Hermann in taking this as equivalent
to mire opiifae'x es, and in omitting the
note of interrogation after senes,
which is retained by Jahn, to the
destrucftion, as it seems to me, of
the sense of the passage, unless he
had also removed the mark of a
question aster chordae and read mire
opffex as a vocative in continuation
of ver. α. This produces an excel-
lent reading, and one which I am
almost inclined to prefer to the ar-
rangement given in the text.

veterum primordia vocum] al.
rerum, a reading which may be
dismissed without comment as nn-
supported by the authority of any
MS. It remains to offer an expla-
nation of the words. WVhatever may
be the external evidence for jahn’s
theory that Caesius Bassus wrote a
poem on the Elements of Langnage
or one De Mctris (cf. Introd.), I can-
not sce that it is in the slightest
degree confirmed by, or even con-
nected with, the interpretation of the
present passage. XVhatever meaning
may be assigned to the expression
Vesermn prt'mom'ia wasme, the natu-
ral explanation of the words inten-
disse nana-ris. . ‚mamm slmpitmnfidn
lalinae would certainly refer them to
a lyrical poeni that could be sung or
set to music aster the style of Ho-
raee’s lyrics, and, in all probability,
not hexametrical. Now anything less
likely to have been set to music than
a Ilexarneter poem de Alelris or one
de Origine vocabulorum can hardly be
conceived. I should consequently

accept the ordinary interpretation
approved of by Macleane, by which
the words are regarded as an allu-
sion to the pedantic style of Bassus,
and to the skill with which he ‘ reset '
in his poems obsolete or antiquated
terms. I am indebted to Mr Paley
for a reference to Martial, XI. 90,
which, taken in connedtion with
Sat. Ι. 77, proves conclusively that
this class of poetry was much as-
fecsted by the literary men of the
period. The epigram in question
runs thus:

Carmina nulla probas molli quae
limite currunt,
Sed quae per salebras ullaque
saxa cadunt,
Et tibi lllaeonio quoque carmine
‘majus habetur,
Luceili columella, hic¹situ',
Metrophanes ;
Atlmzitusque legis terrai frugi-
ferai,
, Attius et quicquid Pacuviusque
vomunt.

5, 6] In this and the next line the ’
readings vary, but they may I think
be reduced to a simple alternative.
Egregios we may at once rejec't with
Jahn and Herm„ as producing no
intelligible meaning, and as easily
corrupted from ign-grim. If jocos is
read, it will clearly denote the lighter
and more playful effusions of the
poet (cf. Ovid. Trisl. 111. 2. 53
Mart. VH. S. 9) in opposition, we
may fairly inser, to his serious com-
positions, a contrast which is readily
obtained by reading senex with the
best MS. If on the other hand
we adopt jocis with Heinrich, it is
the substantive juvenes which now
requires a conti-ast, and this is ob-
tained by reading senes on the
