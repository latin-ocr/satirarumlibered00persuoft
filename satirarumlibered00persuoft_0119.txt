SATIRA VI 91

imaginary opponent on the ground that the heir, when he finds his expecta-
tions disappointed, will neglect the funeral of his predecessor.
38—41. The objection is seconded by Bestius, a type of the class who
resent all such new-fangled Greek notions as Charity and Benevolence.
42—51. A serious conversation between Persius and his prospective
heir, whoever he may be supposed to be: Am I to be thought niggardly
and unpatriotic (says Persius) at a time of public rejoicing merely out 01

regard to your covetous expectations?
52—56. You answer ‘I shall get so much the less.’

Well, if you de-

cline to be my heir, 1 ean always find one by going to the nearest beggars'

stand.

57—60. ‘A son of earth,' you say, contemptuously. Yes, and my
own great-great-grandfather was no better.

61—67. If you are to be my heir, it can only be on the understanding
that you accept gratefully whatever I choose to leave you, not as a right
which you can claim, but as a free gift on my part.

68—74. Do you grumble at the smallness of the amount? Then,
[ather than stint myself to supply your future extravagance, I will at once
defy you by living more luxuriously than Ι have hitherto done.

75—-end, Such a covetous nature as yours will never set a limit to its
desires, any more than Chrysippus will find a man to finish his heap for
him. [In the above analysis I have tried to suggest some sort os connec-
tion between lines 74 and 75, but with little effect, as the transition from
Luxury (vv. 71—74) to the antagonistic passion Avarice (ver. 75) is, to say

the least, abrupt even for Persius]

Admovit iam bruma foco te, Basse, Sabino?

Iamne lyra et tetrico vivunt tibi pectine chordae?

1 Admovit] ‘ So winter, Bassus,
has made you draw near to your
Sabine hem-th! His friend’s place
of residence is elegautly suggested
by this allusion to the homely cus-
toms of the Sabines amongst whom,
as Jahn says, antiquitus ad focum
sedebat fizmill'a conjunffla. Add to
which a contrast may be intended
between the mild climate of Luna
and the colder one os Samnium.

bruma] He had retired there in all
probability for study and retirement,
as well as to avoid the turmoil os the
Saturnalia. That this was the cus-
tom of literary men cf. Hor. Ep. 11.
2. 65 Praeter caetera me Romaene

poemata censes Scribere posse iulet ml
curas totque labores? and again ver.
77 Scrzplorum chorus omnis amat
nunus, afugit urbes.

Basse] See Introduction to Satire.

2—6] ‘ Does the lyre and its strings
wake to lise beneath your manly
quill? A wonderful skill thou hast
in setting to music the early forms os
bygone words and the masculine
strain of the Latin lute, likewise a
rare power of playsully rallying the
young and os exposing old offenders
with dignified satire.⁷ For ludere in
this sense cf. Sat. 1. vv. 117, 127.

2 tetrico] alludes no doubt to
his severe and antiquated style. Cf
