SATIRA IV. 57

Seriolae veterem metuens deradere limum
Ingemit: lzoc bene sits tunicatum curn sale mordens 30
caepe, et farratam pueris plaudentibus ollam

Pannosam faecem morientis sorbet aceti?—
At si unctus cesses et figas in cute solem,
Est prope te ignotus, cubito qui tangat et acre

suum defi‘andans genium compar-
sit miser (Ter. lerm. 1. 1. 10), Isti
qni cum geniis suis bellzgt’l'atzt parci-
promi (Plaut. Trnc. Ι. 2. 81), and
Hor. Carm. 111. 17. 14.

‘28 quandoque] for quandocum-
que, used twice by Horace, Carm. IV.
1. 17, and again IV. 2. 34. Cf. quis-
que for quicumque, Pers. Sat. V. 73.

pertusa] not equivalent to pervia
(as Forcel. Jahn, after the Schol.
who adds in explanation quia per
omnes quattuor partes pateant) but:
calcata, trita, as Heinrich.

compita] The compitalia is meant.
Cf. Cato, Re Rus. v. 4 Rem divi-
nam nisi compitalibus in compito
[villicus] ne saciat. It was one of
the Feriae Concqptivae, held in ho-
nour of the Lares Compitales on or
about the and of January. It is said
to have been instituted by Servius
Tullius and restored by Augustus
(Suet. Aug. 31), and was observed
with seasting (cf. Cato, Re leus. V. 7,
and unc‘la compitalia, Antlml. Lat.
11. 246, 27 B. n. 105, ²7 M.). So
Jahn, who is at a loss however to
account for the dedication of the
plough which is alluded to also by
the Schol. and Tib. ΙΙ. 1. 5. [Surely
it was intended to denote the fac}
that seed-time was passed, and with
it the occasion for the plough]

29 limum] may be the καί of the
jar, or the dirt that has accumulated
u orr it.

pgoltunicatum] Ι have omitted
this w0rd in the translation, believ-
ing it to be simply descriptive os the
bulbous or coated onion as opposed
to the sec‘lile porrum or ‘chives,' of
which latter the green tops alone

were eaten (cf. Mart. 111. 47. 8, X.
48. 9).ι The translation ‘with all its
coats' is somewhat forced, and the
account of the man’s meanness is
complete enough without it.

31 ollam farratam] al. ollae far-
ratae, either of which is preferable
to olla fizrrata, which can only be
taken as an abl. abs. besore the
dative pneris, while for the accus.
cf. Stat. T heb. IV. 11 Plaudit equos.
A jar of ‘oatmeal porridge’ is meant,
cf. Juv. XI. 109, XIV. 1713 sor the
slaves of the miser hold high festival
over what would be the regular food
of another man’s labourers.

32 morientis aceti] So acre potet
acetum, Hor. Sat. 11. 3. 116.

33] ‘You may abuse Vettfflius,
but do not imagine that the opposite
faults will pass unnoticed in your-
self.'

unctus] ‘If you are luxurious and
indolent.' So all the commentators,
who assign to zcnc'lus the same sense
here as it bears in ver. 17 and the
passages quoted under it. I should
much prefer myself to translate it as
:oleo macrus, after which the aprica-
lz'o follows as a matter of course.

34] ‘ Yon will find some stranger
at hand who will nudge you with his
elbow and make avirulent onslaught
on your moral characffer, To think
of your disgy‘acz'ngyeuwelf thusst

3 5 Despuat 111 mores] qm· abomi-
netur in mores tuos (Jahn). Hermann
reads Despuat ‚· lai mores, Sec. but de-
spuat can hardly stand alone, and

pandere may well be the infinitive

of surprise like τοῦτον δὲ ὑβρίζειν,
ἀναπνεῖν δέ (Dem. Mid. ἓ 582).
