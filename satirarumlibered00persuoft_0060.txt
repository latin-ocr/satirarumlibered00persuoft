Vestalesque urnas et Tuscum fictile mutat. 60
O curvae in terris animae et coelestium inanes!

Quid iuvat hoc, templis nostros immittere mores

Et bona dis ex hac scelerata ducere pulpa?

Haec sibi corrupto casiam dissolvit olivo,

Haec Calabrum coxit vitiato murice vellus, 65
Haec baccam conchae rasisse et stringere venas

Ferventis massae crudo de pulvere iussit. ’

prefer myself to take it more gene-
rally, as the ‘Saturnian age’ was
the proverbial reference in all such
cases.

60 Vestalesque urnas]
were made of earthenware to the
last. Cf. Ov. Fczst. 111. 14, Prop.
IV. 4. 16 Urgebat mediam fictilis urna
caput [of the Vestal Tarpeia} With
Tuscum fidile cf. Jnv. XI. 109 Pone-
bant {gitur T usco farrata catino.

62 hoc] lzas Herm. but ‘sufficit
nostros' is Jahn’s laconic criticism.

63 pulpa] so Ausonius, Nec slis
est mihi reglo magl'slro plebeiam
numeros docere pulpam (Ep. IV. 95).

64 Haec] sc. pulpa. ‘This it is that
for a caprice has tainted our olive-
011 with the infusion of cassia, that
has misused purple to dye Cala-
brian fleece. This it is that has
suggested to us to serape the berry
from the shell and to tear the veins
of sused metal from the crude ore.
Vicious it may be: Ι grant it is; but
at least it turns its vices to account ;
whereas tell me, ye priests, what do
we gain by the use of gold in our
services? About as much, Ι imagine,
as the maiden does from the dolls
she dedicates to Venus. Rather 101
us offer to the gods of heaven what
1110 blear-eyed descendant of great
Messala cannot offer from his huge
plate: a mind in which ‹lnty to God
mul man arc harmoniously blended,
a clear conscience in 1110 sceret places
of the heart, a breast engrained with
noble honcsty. Give 1110 these to
talzc into our temples, and with a

These

handful of spelt I’ll win an answer
to my prayers !⁷

64 corrupto] This word and vi-
tiato in the line following are em-
phatic. The man of the old school
considers the substance of the 011 to
be tainted, not improved, by the
admixture of the spice. Cf. Sat.
VI. 40, Virg. Georg. 11. 465. So also
the purple mars the beauty of the
Calabrian fleece, which consisted in
its perfect wlzz'teness; cf. Mart. 11.
43. 3, and ΧΠ. 63. 3 Albi quae
superas oves Galaesi.

Jahn well compares Athen. XV.
686 οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἐξελαύνουσι τῆς
Σπάρτης τοὺς ταῖ μύρα κατασκευά-
ζοντας ὡς διαφθείροντας τοῦλαιον, καὶ
τοὺς τοὶ ἔρια δὲ βάπτοντας ὡς αἶφανί-
ζοντας τὴν λευκότητα τῶν ἐρίων. Cf.
also the use of the words μιαίνειν,
φθείρειν of dyeing.

66 baccam conchae] the pearl.
Cf. Plin. lx. 35. 54.

stringere] de iis asm‘palm’ quae
tam ardle conjuncJa atque mixta
szmt, ut non nisi summa contentione
discerni possint. Cf. Lucr. 1. 486.

(Jahn.)

70 pupae] This dedication osv
their playthings was 3 sign that
childhood was ended. (Jahn.) Cf.
V. 31 Bullaque succinens Laribus
donata pependit, and the following
epigram (Am‘lzol. Pal. VI. 280):

Τιμαρέτα πρὸ ’γάμοιο ‘roff τύμπανα, τήν
τ’ ἐρατεινήν
σφαῖραν, τόν τε κόμας ῥύτορα κε-
κρύψαλον
