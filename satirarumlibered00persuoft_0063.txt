SATIRA ΙΙΙ. 35

52—63„ but then you possess advantages of a special character and yet
deliberately neglect thern.

64-76, At present the lessons which philosophy enforces may cure
you, but, if you rejeci: thern, your case will soon become desperate.

77-87‚ The multitude, 1 know, deride the teaching of philosophy: but
let us anticipate the result of disregarding it in your own case 3

88-106‚ sels-indulgence and the neglect of proper remedies end in
physical sickness and death:

107- 118, the neglect of Philosophy is as certain death to your moral
nature.

Of this Satire the Scholiast writes as follows, Hanc satiram poeta ex
Lucilii Lib. iv. transtulit, castigantis luxuriam divitum et vitia. The frag-
ments which we possess of the book in question are to a certain extent
similar in point of subject, though not sufficiently so as to warrant anything

like a charge of plagiarism against Persius. (Jahn.)

Nempe haec assidue: iam clarum mane fenestras

Intrat et angustas extendit lumine rimas 3
Stertimus indomitum quod despumare Falernum

1—7] In the opening lines of the
Satire Ι have (with one slight ex-
ception) followed Hermann's ar-
rangement, who regards vv. 1-4 as
the soliloquy of the professor, vv.
5-6 as addressed by a companion
to the sleeping pupil. Jahn assigns
the whole passage (vv. 1—6) to the
comes,· but, read thus, the scene
lacks animation and the monologue
is too long and heavy sor the occa-
sron.

The position in which the philo-
sopher stands to his pupil is well
suggested in a passage quoted by
Gifford from Aul. Gell. x. 6 Nunc
wilere cst philosophos ultro currere, nt
doceant, adfores juvenum divitum,
eosque ibi sedere atque opperim' prope
ad meridiem donec discipuli noc‘2ur-
num omnavinum edormz'ant,· and
Persius himself appears to have re-
ceived Cornutus into his house and
family. (Cf. Suet. Gram. 7, Rlzet. 6.)

1 Nempe] ‘Yes, this is always
the way.¹ The ironical expostulation

is made more forcible by omitting the
note of interrogation after assidue.

clarum mane] For the use of
mane as a nominative, cf. Virg.
Georg. 111. 32 5 Dum mane novum,
dum gramina canent.

fenestras] ‘ The shutters.' The
fenestrae were unglazed apertures,
closed upon occasion with shutters
(tabulae) between which the light
now makes its way. Occasionally
they were fitted with specularia,
windows of mica (lapis specularis),
though not so apparently in the
presergt instance. (Cf. Macl. 012 Juv.
111. 2 8.)

2 extendit] ‘ Makes the narrow
chiuks seem wider with the admis-
sion of light!

3 stertimus] ‘Yet wc are snor-
ing enough to work off the effeets
of the fiery Falernian, while thc
line that marks the fifth hour is
touched by the shadow of the rod.²

mdomitum] Horace calls it ar-
dens, severum, and Lucan (Χ. 163)
