SATIRA V. 67

Et premitur ratione animus, vincique laborat,
Artificemque tuo ducit sub pollice vultum. 40
Tecum etenim longos memini consumere soles,

Et tecum primas epulis decerpere noctes:

Unum opus, et requiem pariter disponimus ambo,

Atque verecunda laxamus seria mensa.
Non equidem hoc dubites, amborum foedere certo 45

from ‘pruning down' an over-luxu-
riant foliage (cf. Hor. Carm- Ι. 31. 9
Fremant Calena falce quibus dedit
Fortuna vitem) or from ‘breaking
in' a eolt (cf. Virg. Aen. VI. Sofera
corda domans fingitque premendo, of
the Sibyl). The latter is Jahn's ex-
planation, and is, Ι think, borne out
by vincique laborat which is certainly
a ‘training’ metaphor (cf. sitque la-
boranti similis, Virg. Georg. 111. 193,
of a young colt).

vincique laborat] ‘is conquered
not without a struggle) This is
more forcible than the ordinary ren-
dering ‘desires to be conquered‚’ and
is justified by the analogous passage
quoted above from Virgil’s Gemgics.

40 Artificem] sc. arte fallam.
For this use of the word in the
passive sense of ‘artistic‚ fimkllea'
work’ Jahn well compares artifices
argutiae (Plin. X. 29. 43), artifi’x
motus (Quint. IX. 4. 8), and aspi-
ramz'na artificis formae (Val. Flac.
vl. 465). For the metaphor itself
cf. Ov. Met. X. 284 Ut Hymettia
sole Cera remollescit, trattataque pol-
lice multas Flectitur in facies ; Juv.
Π Ι. 237 Exigite ut mores teneros cm
pollice ducat, Ut si quis cera vultum
jacit,· where ducere, as in the present
passage, is to ‘shape,’ ‘mould.'

41 consumere soles] Cf. V irg.
Ecl. IX. 5 1 Saepe ego longos Cantando
puerum memini me condere soles.

42 decerpere] lit. ‘to clip off '
(cf. leorae subsecivae). ‘ 1 stole from
the banquet the early hours of the
night,' sc. sor the purposes of study
«εἴ. Sal. 111. 54 and V. 62). This is, Ι

think, decidedly preferable to Jahn's
interpretation epulas in primam noc-
tis partem protrahere which is un-
suited to the character of Persius or
his friend, and moreover anticipates
ver. 44.

43] ‘Our tasks were shared in
common : our hours of rest arranged
on by agreement) Cs. ‘Omnibus una
quies operum, labor omnibus idem,
Virg. Gem‘g. IV. 184.

45—5 1] ‘You cannot, I think,
doubt this, that our days are set in
unison by some fixed principle and
are derived from a single constella-
tion, whether it be that the F ate
who cannot lie is poising our lives
in the even-balanced scales, or that
the natal hour of two faithful friends
ap portioris to the Gemini our harmo-
nious destinies, while by the auspices
of our common planet Jupiter we
crush the baleful influence of satum.
Some star there is, beyond all doubt,
that binds me to you.²

45 equidem] Cf. note on Sat. Ι.
r 10. The poem of Manilius de
Astris is the best commentary on
the lines which follow. The Romans
appear to have taken particular de-
light in playing thus 011 the subjecst
of the Zodiac (cf. especially the
parallel passageinHor. Carnum. 17.
17 sqq), add to which, as Jahn well
remarks, astrologorum doc'lrina apud
Romanos in dies majori-m fidem nan·
cii-sebatur, imprnnis inde a Tiberio,
qui liis artibus deditus crat.

45 foedere certo] Cf. Man. Astr.
11. 477 fflznxit amicitias horum sub
foedere certo.
