16 A. PERSII FLACCI

Sunt quos Pacuviusque et verrucosa moretur

Antiopa, aerumnis cor luctificabile fulta.
Hos pueris monitus patres infundere lippos
Quum videas, quaerisne, unde haec sartago loquendi 80
Venerit in linguas, unde istud dedecus, in quo
Trossulus exsultat tibi per subsellia levis?
Nilne pudet capiti non posse pericula cano
Pellere‚ quin tepidum hoc optes audire decenter?
Fur es, ait Pedi03 Pedius quid? crimina rasis 85
Librat in antithetis, doctas posuisse figuras
ver. 82. exultet 7.

Brisaei is an epithet of Bacchus
transferred to the poet, as ταυροφά-
’γος to Cratinus, either because he
was given to wine or because he
was a tragic poet and wrote on sub-
jects closely connected with the
worship of the God (Cf. Juv. VI.
70, Personam thyrsumque tenent et
sublzgrar A cci).

Atti] Flornit A. C. 136.

venosus] ‘coarse‚' ‘turgid’ cf. va-
ricosus Sat. V. 187. This censure, as
Jahn well remarks, does not affe&
the reputation of these poets cum
vituperetur stulta tantum imitatio
quae ea inde sumit quae non sequenda.

77 Pacuvius] Floruz’t Ac. 149.
A native of Brundisium and nephew
of Ennius.

verrucosa] warty. For the epi-
thets venosus, verrucosa cf. Tac. (Ρ)
Dial. de Or. 21.

79-—83] ‘When you see pur-

blind fathers infuse teaching like „

this into their sons’ ears do you ask
whence this inedley of speech has
found its way into our tongue,
whence this disgraceful poetry oven·
which your effeminate noble fidgets
upon the benches?‘

79 lippos] morally blear-eyed, as
in 11. 72, v. 77.

80 sartago] a stewpan, used like
farrago Juv. 1. 86.

82 Trossulus] a title bestowed
upon the Equites, perhaps sor taking
Trossulum in Etruria without the

aid of the infantry, but more pro-
bably as= T rojugenae, cf. ver. 4.
Here used ironically.

exsultat] the same as trepidare
ver. 20, though Jahn and Macleane
explain it de nimia in laudando et
acclamando licenlia; but cf. ver. 87,
which is almost conclusive.

subsellia] may be the benches in
the recitatzon roonis but, more pro-
bably, in the law courts, as it· sost-
ens the otherwise abiupt transition
from poetry to law: ‘I say in the law
courts, for are you not ashamed‚
Pedius, that you cannot ward off
the danger from a hoary head with-
out longing to hear the lukewarni
praise ‘Pretty good ?’ ’

8 5 ait] says the prosecutor to
Pedius, ‘and how does Pedius take
it? He weighs the charge in polish-
ed antitheses : he wins applause for
the elever metaphors he introduces)
In other words, no righteous indig-
nation for him at the expense of his
style.

Pedius] On this passage Jahn
writes as sollowzs Etl' dms qul iem,
qui,f1{7tt accusatus, dr ctas in dfen-
Alone-figimus posuisse dicll‘llr, ln qllo
cl ipse, qui ne in capitis( quzdem dts-
(7 lmine ab inani illa ost ntatzzme
abstinuit, et populus notatur, qui arti-
ficium polius laudat quam foedum
crimen abominatur, non dubito quin
Pedius Blaesus sit A. 813 repetun-
darum danmatus, quamquam miro
