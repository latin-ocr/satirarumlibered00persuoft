A. PERsn FLACCI

Fenoris accedat merces3 hinc exime sumptus!

Quid reliquum est? Reliquum? nunc, nunc impensius unge,
Unge‚ puer, caules! mihi festa luce coquatur

Urtica et fissa fumosum sinciput aure, 70
Ut tuus iste nepos olim satur anseris extis,

Quum morosa vago singultiet inguine vena,

but the use of repone denotes a spe-
cial allusion to advice which Persius
had given, a fact which has been
observed by several of the commen-
tators, who have consequently en-
deavoured to explain it as a reference
to ver. 2 5 M2’sse tenus propria vive
et granaria (fas est) Emole, which
is however a recommendation to
liberality rather than to economy.
I cannot but fancy that this is one
of the few passages to which we
may legitimately apply the statement
of the biographer Versus aliqui
dempti sunt ultimo libro, and under-
stand the expression dlc‘la repone
paterna as a reference to certain
remarks which the poet had intended
to introduce into the earlier portion
of the satire, possibly into a denun-
ciation of extravagance, a subjeot
which he has touched upon but no
more in vv. 21, 22.

67 merces] as in Quinas laic capili
mercedes exsecat (Hor. Sal. 1. 2. 14)
and Mercedem aut nummos unde
unde extricat (Sat. Ι. 3. 88).

68 Quid. reliquum esw] is the
question of the discontented heir,
which provokes Persius, or the man
he represents, into declaring that
he will now live more expensively
than before, ‘Is there any reason
why 1 should have nettles for a
holiday dinner and dried pig’s cheek
with split ears, to enable that
scapegrace son of yours to fill him-
self one day with the liver of a
goose?'

70 urtica] For urtica Jahn well
compares Hor. Ep. 1. 12. 8 Si
fortein medio positorum abstemius
herbis Vivis et urtica, and sor sinci-

put Hor. Sat. 11. 2. 116 Videas—

colonum Non ego, narrantem, temere
edi luce profesta Quicquam praeter
olus fumosae cum pedepernae‚ though,
strangely enough, he explains fumo-
sum fissa aure as=vetustate jam
corrosum on the strength of the
following passage from Petron. 135
pannum de carnario detulit ficrca,
in quo faba erat ad usum reposita
et sincspitzs vetustissima particula
mille plage& dolata.

71 tuus iste nepos] This casual
mention of the nepos, whose existence
whether in the present or the future
has never before been hinted at,
appears to me another evidence of
incompleteness in the satire. ,It is
more than possible that he was to
have been introduced in the protest
against extravagance to which I have
alluded on ver. 66.

anseris extis] Cf. Juv. v. 1¹4
A meris ante ipsum magni jecur.

72 morosa] is I think a strong
confimiation of the reading amarum
in the precisely similar passage Sal.
IV. 48. Mr Paley however suggests
that morosus may be equivalent to
morus and the Gk. μωρὸς, and may
mean no more than the Latin impu-
dicus. Cf. Plaut. Trin. ΠΙ. 2. 43
and the usage of the word μάταιος.

73 trama figurae] a ‘thread-
paper figure‚' as trama is the thread
of the woof which crosses that of
the upright stamen or war-p, and
when the nap is worn off the eloth
these threads are laid bare. Cf.
Eur. Aut. Frag. 111. 12 τρίβωνες
ἐκλείποντες οἴχονται κρόκας and Sen.
Ep. XC. 20 Posidonius dum ved!
describere.. . quemadmodum subtemen
