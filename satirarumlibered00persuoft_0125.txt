SATIRA VI. 97

Ingentes de puppe Dei, iamque obvia mergis 30
Costa ratis lacerae: nunc et de cespite vivo

Frange aliquid, largire inopi, ne pictus oberret

Caerulea in tabula—Sed coenam funeris heres

Negliget, iratus quod rem curtaveris‚· urnae

Ossa inodora dabit, seu spirent cinnama surdum, 35
Seu ceraso peccent casiae, nescire paratus:

Tune bona incolumis minuas? Et Bestius urget

fida notat. (Jahn.)

30 de puppe Dei] Cf. Ov. Trist.

puppique recurvae, Insilit et pistos

is-‘ open to seagulls.'

31 et de cespite vivo] i.e. Charity
requires you not only to grind out
your corn for his use but even to
give him a piece of your landed
property (like elargiri Sat. ΙΙΙ. 71).

3² oberret] ‘that he may not
have to roam the country.' For
oberret cf. Sat. V. 166, and for cae-
rulea tabula Sat. Ι. 89 and note.

33] The objection of some imagi-
nary opponent, certainly not of
Bassus to whom it has been referred
by some commentators: ‘But your
heir (you say) will neglect your
funeral feast in his rage at the cur-
tailment of the property: he will
consign your bones to the urn un-
perfumed, with a determination not
to know that the cinnamon is scent-
less and the cassia adulterated with
cherry bark.’

33 coenam funeris] ‘Caena fune-
ris seu funebris erat duplicis generis.
una diis manibus in rogo parabatur
proprieque vocabatur silicernium (cf.
feralis caena Juv. V. 85), alleraproxc‘-
mis et amicis eamque vocabant epu-

pro Mur. 36, 75, Suet. Caes. 26, 38).

often specially enjoined in the will.
Cf. epulum arbitrio Arri (Hor. Sat.
11. 3. 86).

35 inodora] Cf. Ov. Trist. 111. 3.
69 Atque ea (se. ossa) cum filiis et
amomi pulvere misce, and Tib. 111.
2. 2 3 Illuc quas mittit dives Pan-
chaia merces, Eoique Arabes, pinguis
et Assyria.

surdum] Cf. ver. 28, on which
Jahn adds that it denotes anything
dull or uncertain, as in this passage
a faint smell, in Juv. VII. 71 a dull
sound (surda buccina), and in Pliny,
XXXVII. 5. 18, a faint colour (inter-
currit umbra, surdusque fit color).

37 Tune bona incolumis minuas]
Tunc bona incolumis minuas? Macl.
after a few MSS, an instance of
perverse reading to which we may
well apply the criticism of Hermann
on another proposed emendation,
Ego vero malos versus vel optimis
poetis interdum excz'derse nunquam
negavi, bonos conjec‘lando pessumdari
licere etiam nunc pernego, for this so-
called emendation produces a hiatus
in the verse, involves the passage iu
obscurity, and results in the follow-
ing far-setched translation: ‘ And
then would you not be mad to cur-
tail your estate?' There is no reason
to doubt that the reading printed in
the text is the true one, aud that it
is not the remark of the heres (as
Jahn supposes, thereby making con-
fusion worse confounded by the in-
