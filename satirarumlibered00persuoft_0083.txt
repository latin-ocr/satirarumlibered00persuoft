SATIRA IV. 55

Desinis, Anticyras melior sorbere meracas!
Quae tibi summa boni est? uncta vixisse patella

Semper et assiduo curata cuticula sole?

Exspecta, haud aliud respondeat haec anus.

I nunc: 'J ς

Dinomaches ego sum! suffla: sum candidus! esto& fao
Dum ne deterius sapiat pannucia Baucis,
Quum bene discincto cantaverit ocima vernae.

coenare sine unc'Zo. Here it is put
generally for a ‘ luxurious table.’

18 curata cuticula sole] more
definite than cutem, pelliculam cn-
rare, which refers generally to good
living. Here the apricatio is meant:
cf. Juv. ΧΙ. 203 Nostra bibat vernum
contradict cuticula solem. It was re-
sorted to either (i) to improve the
complexion, as in Mart. Χ. 12. 7

[precor et totos ovida cute combibe
soles.

Quam formosus eris dnm peregrinus
eris ,Ι

or (ii) to benefit the heahh, by old

men and valetudinarians. Cf. aprici
vaes, Sat. v. 179, Cic. Cat. Mas. XVI.
56, Plin. Ep 111. 5. 10.

19] Jahn and Macl. 11 eaken the
soree of the following passage by
removing the stop after I nunc, and
making Dinomaches ego sum depend
upon szffla. It is sar preferable to
regard l nnnc, soffia, esto as the
ironical comments of the philoso-
pher upon each boast as it is uttered :
‘Wait a minute: this old woman
would give us no other answer. Now
then proceed. A son of Dinomache
am l! Puff away. l am beautiful!
Small merit in that, if ragged Baucis
here 15 as wise as you are when she
has cried her herbs successfully to
some slatternly slavste

20 Dinomaches] In Alc. 1. ¹23 c
he is called by Socrates ο Δεινομάχης
υἱός, and through her he was con-
neaed with the family of the Alc—
maeonidae.

suffla] lit. to ‘ inflate the cheeks,’

and so used of any bombastic utter
ance 3 cf. Nec stloppo tmnidas intendis
rumpere buccas (V. 13), pulmonem
rumpere: (ΙΙΙ. 27); also the Greek
φυσᾶν ἑαυτόν (Bergl. ad Alcz'plzr.. 1.
37) and the proverbial expression
φυσα Ὑᾶρ οὐ σμικροῖσιν αὐλίσκοις
ἔτη.

esto] Gk. εἶεν, ‘Y ou may be all
that and yet not fitted for your post,
if your only wisdom is that of a
common herbu ornan who praises
her wares to good purpose.y

21 pannucia] either ‘'ragged as
Petr. 14, or ‘wrinkled' as pannucia
mala, Plin. xv. 14, 15.

Baucis] the name of an old w oman
in Anth. Pal. v.11 710, 712, and per-
haps adopted here from some Greek
comedy or from the mimes of So-
phron, whom Persius is thought
to have imitated. Like mmmm,
Natta, Stonus Dama, ἃς. it points
to no particular person but denotes
a class.

22 bene] unquestionably to be
joined with cantaverit as the sense of
the passage indicates, and not with
ιζίιττιηιῑῖὀ (as Jahn an’d Macl. ) where

it is 11 eak and adds nothing to the
picture.

discinctoJ‘ ‘dissolute’

slovenlyss
So again dz'sczfzdlz Nattae (Sat. 111.
31), and dtlrcindlns mpos (Hor. Epod.
1 34). Aloose flowing robe denoted
indolence and luxury; cf. the oppos.
masniolus, allicim‘lus, and the Gk.
εὐσταλής, εὔζωνος.

ocima] may be basil or water-
cress.
