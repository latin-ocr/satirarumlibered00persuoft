SATIRA 1. 17

Laudatur: bellum hoc! Hoc bellum? an, Romule, ceves?
Men' moveat quippe et, cantet si naufragus, assem
Protulerim? cantas, quum' fraCta te in trabe pictum
Ex humero portes? verum nec nocte paratum v 90
Plorabit, qui me volet incurvasse querella.—

Sed numeris decor est et iunctura addita crudis.
Claudere sic versum didicit: Berecyntius Attis ,·
Et: qm caeruleum dirimebat Nerea delphin ,-
Sic: costam longo subduximus Appennino. 95

Arma virum, nonne hoc spumosum et cortice pingui,

ver. 87. bellum est γ.

casu Horatius (Sat. 1. 10. 28) Pe·
dium inter celebres causarum patro-
nos nominat. With the greatest
deference for Jahn's opinion, Ι must
confess my inability to accept the
above conclusion for the following
reasons: (i) this mention by name of
a criminal and his crime would be a
personality absolutely without a par-
allel in the whole of the Satires;
(ii) to represent a man as courting
applause when he is on a trial
for life or death would be an ex-
travagance, at any rate in our au-
thor 3 (iii) it was the custom os
Persius to draw on Horace for the
names of his-charae‘ters. I should
therefore regard the allusion as en-
tirely general and the words Fur es

as meaning no more than ‘you are a
scoundrel.'

86 doctas] doctus Scal. but figuras
requires an epithet and doctus is
weak (Herm.).

87 bellum] again only qualified
praise: ‘ a pretty expression that !’

88—90] ‘If a shipwrecked sailor
were to aceost me singing, it’s likely,
isn’t it, that he would move me
or that I should hand him a penny?
what you sing, do you, when you
are carrying about a picture of
yourself astride a broken plank ?’

88 Mene moveat. quippe] Mene
moveat? [sc. Pedius] quippe... Macl. ;
but the position of quippe is made

PERS.

far more awkward by the change.

89 pictum] CfiJu'v. xxv, 301 sqq.
Hor. Ars Poet. 20 sqq.

90] ‘A true tale 'of sorrow, not
one conned over night.’ So Juv.
Ι. 51, Venusina digna lucerna, and
again IV. 34, Non est Cantmzdzcm,
res vera agitur.

9²] ‘ But you must at least allow
that we have added grace and unity
to what were before unpolished
verses. Our poet has learned to
close a line thus.’ The three verses
which follow are unconnetfted quo-
tations and should be printed se-
parately. They are specimens of
the decor which he contrasts with
the ‘roughness' of the Aeneid. The
junctura is exemplified below in
ver. 99 sqq.

9 5] ‘ we stole a rib from lengthy
Apennine ’ may allude generally to
a forced march (cf. Patavi tam
pauca millia subripi posse, Sen. Ep.
L111.)‚ or, more particularly, to the
device ascribed to Hannibal,l1l0ntem
rumpit aceto.

96] ‘Compare with this arma
virum: isn’t it turgid and thick-
skinned like an old bough sun-dried
on a huge corktree ‘2⁷ According to
this arrangement of the lines, which
Ι much prefer to that suggested by

Jahn, Persius does not break in
until ver. 98.
