SATIRA VI.

Largior 3 an prohibes? dic clare! Non adeo, inquis:

Exossatus ager iuxta est.

Age, si mihi nulla

Iam reliqua ex amitis, patruelis nulla, proneptis

Nulla manet patrui, sterilis matertera vixit,

Deque avia nihilum superest, accedo Bovillas 55
Clivumque ad Virbi, praesto est mihi Manius heres.

49 induco] sc. in arenam. For
the number centum paria, which
would involve an enormous expense,
cf. Hor. Sat. 11. 3. 85 Ni sic fecissent,
gladiatorum dare centum Damnati
populo paria atque epulum.

50 artocreas] An unusual word
in place of the more ordinary visce-
ratio. It occurs however in an in-
scription quoted by Jahn. The
visceratio was usually a distribution
of bread and meat (cf. Suet. Caes.
383Ci0· de Off 11. 16. 553 Livy, v111.
22. 2), and the oil is apparently an
extra introduced from another class
oflargess (cf. Suet. Caes. 38, Ner. 12).

5² Exossatus] The uncertainty
as to the meaning of this word has
given rise to two different explana-
tions of the passage. The literal
meaning of exossatus is ‘deprived
of bones,’ like a fish which has been
prepared sor the table. Cf. Plaut.
Amph. Ι. 1. 163 Exossatum os esse
oportet, quem probe percusseris, and
A ulul. 11. 9. 2 lisuraenam exdorsua,
atque omnia exossata fac sient. The
nearest approach to this literal sense
in the present instance would be
made by removing (with Hermann
and others) the stop after inquis and
translating exossatus ⁶ cleared of
stones,' an explanation which is
justified by Ov. flletam. 1. 39 3 Lapi-
des in corpore terrae Ossa reor dici ,-
jacere lzos post terga jubemur, and by
the fa& that this is one of the first
steps towards reclaiming a piece of
waste mountain land. Taken thus,
the passage will mean ‘our field

is not in such prime order as to
admit of such extravagance.’ In
spite however of the above arg-u-
ments I believe that the other inter-
pretation, which is accepted by
Jahn and Macleane, is the true oue,
by which a full stop is placed after
inquis, and exossatus is taken in the
sense of ‘impoverished' (lit. ‘with
the marrow extracted from the
bones ⁷). There is something pecu-
liarly effec‘tive in this hesitating
answer of the heir, ‘ 1 can⁷t quite
forbid it: but let me suggest to you
that your land is impoverished;’
while the metaphor is admirably
illustrated by such passages as Hor.
Epod. V. 37 Exsud'ia uti medulla et
aridum jecur Amoris esset poculum ,-
Juv. VIII. 90 Ossa vides regum vacuis
exsuffla medullis; and, in particular,
Luc. Tim. 8 οἱ δὲ τὰ ὀστᾶ ’γυμνώ-
σαντες ἀκριβῶς καὶ περιτραγόντες, εἴ

αὖον αὐτὸν καὶ τὰς ῥίζας ὑποτετμημέ-
νον ἀπολιπόντες.

53 amitis—matertera] The form-
er denotes a fallit-Vs sister, the latter
a mother‘s sister, or maternal aunt.

55 Bovillas] Bovillae z‘ulerl307nam
et Ariciam jacebant, prima in Via
Appia statio. (Jahn.) Cf. Ov. Fast.
ΙΙΙ. 667 Orta suburbanis quaedam
ficit Anna Bovillis. It appears that
Persius had an estate in this neigh-
bourhood, which may account for
the mention of it in the present
passage.

56 clivumque ad. Vir-bi] sc. the
clivusA ricinus on the road to Aricia
and the temple and grove of Diana.
