SATIRA II.

29

Nunc Licini in campos, nunc Crassi mittit in aedes:

Hunc optet generum rex et regina3 puellae

Hunc rapiant 3 quidquid-calcaverit hic, rosa fiat!

Ast ego nutrici non mando vota3 negato,

Iuppiter, haec illi, quamvis te albata rogarit.

40

Poscis opem nervis corpusque fidele senectae:
Esto age: sed grandes patinae tuccetaque crassa
Adnuere his superos vetuere Iovemque morantur.

ver. 39. mando haec vota Ὑ.

fascinare. On this word Jahn well
remarks, Usu venit, nt idem qnod
fascinum arceat sit eliam quam maxi-
me contumeliosum, nam quem quis
summa efficere vult injuria euin con-
spuit, unde de persona vel re, quoe
cnm contemtu vel contumelia rejici-
tur, dicitnr despuere, προσπτύειν,
περι-πτύειν, ἀποπτύειν, quamquam
ln's verbis saepe non solum contume-
lia indicatur, sea' quod res tanquam
portentum et mali ominis exsecratur.

36 Licini] He was originally a
slave, and afterwards the steward of
Caius Julius Caesar, by whom he
was manumitted and appointed to a
procuratio in Gaul. For his wealth
ef. Juv. 1. 109 Ego possideo plns
Pallante et Licinis.

Crassi] Cf. Cic. adAtt. Ι. 4. 3, and
Sen. Ep. CXIX. ἓ 10 Quorum nomina
cum Crasso Licinoque numerantur.

37 rex et regina] Jahn regards
this as equivalent to proceres ; cs.
Sat. Ι. 67. But in an extravagant
prayer like this it is surely better
to take the words in their literal
sense, even supposing that regina
ean be used for a ‘great lady‚’ of
which there appears to be no ex-
ample except in comedy.

40 albata] As being the ordinary
dress of worshippers. Cf. Hor. Sat.
11. 2. 61, Plaut. lead. Ι. 5. ῐῐ, Ti-
bul. 11·. 1. 16.

41—51] ‘You are praying, my
sm'end, for strength for your sinews,
and a constitution on which you may
rely to meet old age. Very good ;

ver. 40. lzoc illi quamvis te albata rogabit γ.

but huge dishes and rich forced
meats have debarred the gods above
from granting your request and clog
the power of Jupiter. And you,
my friend, are eager to amass riehes
by sacrificing kine, and with entrails
invoke the aid of Mercury: Grant
tlzat I may enriclz my‘fizmily: grant
me cattle and produce from my
flocks! How can he, most per-
verse of men, when you are wast-
ing to nothing over the flames so
many heifers⁷ cauls? Yet notwith-
standing he strains every nerve to
carry his point by offering entrails
or else rich cake. ,Νοῦν (he says)
my field increases, and now my sold .·
now it will be given me, now, surely
now! until deluded and despondent
he sighsr forth, All useless: see my
lost penny at tlce bottom of my
clzcstl'

41—43] So Diog. Laert. VI. 2. 28
ἐκίνει αὐτὸν τὸ θύειν τοῖς θεοῖς ὑπὲρ
ὑγιείας, ἐν αὐτῇ δὲ τῇ θυσίᾳ κατὰ τῆς
ὑγιείας δειπνεῖν (Jahn), a quotation-
singularly appropriate, as tucceta
appears to be specially used of sacri-
ficial meats.

4² grandes] so Jahn, Herm.; pin-
gues al. and Ὑ. But Herm. well com-
pares grandes rhombos patinasque
(Hor. Sat. 11. 2. 95). Besides which,
pingues and crassae would represent
the same idea.

tucceta] cibus qni fit cx carnium
concisione, sicut salcicia est (Papias).

43 vetuere] Notice the tense:
the misehief is already done.
