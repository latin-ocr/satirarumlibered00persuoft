SATIRA IV.

JAHN regards this poem as no satire in the ordinary sense of the word,
but rather as a scholastic dissertation on the readiness of mankind to dete&
saults in others while they ignore their own, illustrated by examples which
are general not personal, types of a class rather than carieatures of indi-
viduals. Accordingly he classes it with Satires II. ΙΙΙ. V. and VI. (all of
which are unquestionably of this character), and regards the first as the sole
exception to the rule in which he recognizes an attack on the literary taste
of Nero. His view of the Satire has been advocated by Schutz, Weber
and others.

In the Introduction to the Satires I have stated at length my reasons for
adopting the opposite theory, supported as it is by the equally great names
of Britannicus, Casaubon, Meister and others—that this Satire‚ so far from
being general in its allusions‚ is directed from first to last at the incapacity
and immorality of Nero’s government. To avoid repetition, I will only
refer to line 49 Si puteal multa cautus vibice flagellas which appears to Ine
conclusive on the subject, and it would be hardly too much to say that
no portion os Persius contains a more definite allusion to Nero than this.
Understood thus, each and every word in the sentence finds an appro-
priate commentary in Tac. Amr. XIII. 2 5, Suet. Nero, 26, while no other
theory suggests even a tolerable explanation for multa vibice, to say nothing
os the rest of the line.

We may therefore class the poem with the first Satirc and rcgard it as
a personal attack on Nero, on the ground of—

1—- 5, his youth and inexperience;

6- 9, his want of eloquence3

10—14‚ his ignorance of all distinctions between right and wrong ;

15—24, his sels-conceit on the ground of his noble birth and personal
beauty‚ as though these were cverything and knowledge nothing3

25-52, his indolence, luxury and wanton debauchery.

The dialogue is framed on the model of the xst Alcibiades of Plato,
passages of which are directly imitated in the opening lines os the Satirc.
