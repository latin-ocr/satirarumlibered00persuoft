20 A. PERSII FLACCI

Meiitel—Discedo. Secuit Lucilius urbem,

Te Lupe, te Muci, et genuinum fregit in illis,

115

Omne vafer vitium ridenti Flaccus amico
Tangit et admissus circum praecordia ludit,
Callidus excusso populum suspendere naso:

Men' mutire nefas? nec clam, nec cum scrobe? Nusquam.

Hic tamen infodiam: vidi, vidi ipse, libelle:

Auriculas asini quis non habet? hoc ego opertum,

Hoc ridfre meum, tam nil, nulla tibi vendo

Iliade.

δράκοντες παρετίθεντο, Prop. IV. 8. 3,
Virg. Aen. V. 84, and espec. Lau-
rentius, Veteres Gentiles serpentes ap-
pinxere ad conciliandam loco sacro
reverentiam quos mystae suos genios
inteissrelabantnr. (St.)

[Since writing the above I have
been enabled, by the kindness of
Mr Burn of Trin. Coll., to see an
exact copy of the painting and in-
scription alluded to by Jahn, which
bears out my theory that the emblem
is only indm-[tly prohibitory, and
that the primary notion is that of
consecration or dedication. It repre-
sents the altar of the ‘ Genius Loci'
with the plate of sacrifice upon it,
and the two serpents guarding it one
on either side. Cf. also the following
from Jahn, Ita in anaglypho genius
theatri sub imagine [limais apparet,
et in pistura quadam (Pitt. Ere. IV.
13) anguis arae circumvolutus est,
ea quae arae imposita suut depascens,
cum inscriptione: genius hujus loci
montis]

¹14 discedo] ⁴ 1 obey the order—-
and yet Lucilius lashed the city and
its magnates, and broke his tooth
on them?

115 Lupe] P. Rutilius Lupus
Cons. (Cf. Cic. de Fz'n. 1. 3) and
Quintus Mucius Scaevola (Cf. Juv.
1. 154).

fflis] rather than vobis to suit
urbem, ‘it and you.'

116 ridenti] ‘smiling the while.'

Audaci quicumque afflate Cratino

1 18 excusso] Not: emuncJae na-
ris as Jahn; but cf. excusso sago
(Mart. 1. 4. 8) of a blanket ‘drawn
tight and even.’ So here it means
an ‘unwrinkled nose,’ i.e. one which
sneered without appearing to do so,
as opposed to the nasum rhinocerotis
in ver. 6 of the above Epigr.

1 19 mutire] ‘ Mayn't I so much
as mutter? in oppos. to the slashing
satire of secare.

cum scrobe] ‘into a hole.) Cf.
Ov. Met. ΧΙ. 180 sqq. sor the story
of Midas' barber.

Nusquam] I prefer to follow Jahn,
who prints this word as the answer
of the critic like nolo in ver. 10.
Macleane retains Herm aun’s reading,
nec clam, nec cum scrobe, nusquam? ⁷
but removes the note of interrogation
after nusquam. This ignores the ta-
men in the next line and produces as
monotonous a repetition as his ver-
sion of ver. a.

120 Hic] in the pages of my
book.

121 quis non] Cf. Introd. Is the
story of the old reading be accepted
as true, the punffi‘tuation adopted by
Macleane is indefensible.

opertum] ‘ This secret, this laugh
of mine, trisse though it is, I would
not sell you sor any Iliad in the
world!

1²3 Iliade] He means the Iliad
of Homer, rather than the transla-
tion by Labeo as Maeleane sup-
