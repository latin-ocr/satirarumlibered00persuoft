much weight to his theory on the
subje& os comites (111. 7) when he
explains blandi thus: Comites, qui

adulto jam blandi fuerunt. What-
ever may be the meaning of comites
in that passage the simpler interpre-
tation is certainly preferable here

34 iter ambiguum] In this and
the following 11116 116 refers again to
the¹ symbol os the Pythagorean Τ

‘ when companions
Jahn has given too

lu fallere Ὑ.

(cf. note on Sat. 111. 56): ‘When the
path is doubtful and the indecision
caused by inexperience of life is
drawing unsettled minds towards
one or other of the branching cross-
roads.’

35 Diducit] deducit Jahn, while in
the precisely similar passage (Sat. 111.
56) he reads diducit. Deducit would
mean ‘draws from the right path'
which is more than is intended by
the metaphor, as all that is implied
by error is the possibility os, his
mistaking the road, the habilior to
go astray rather than the foll that
he does so.

36 supposui—suscipis] The 01·-
dinary usage os these words, as Jahn
remarks, denotes a connecfflion al-
most as close as that implied by
adoption.

37 fallere sollers] ‘skilsully and
unobtrusively applied straightcns my
warped morals.’ Cf. the description
of Horace’s satire 111 1. 116 sqq.
Jahn takes it differently, but, as
