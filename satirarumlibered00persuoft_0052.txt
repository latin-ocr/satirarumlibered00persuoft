24 A. PERSII FLACCI

Qui tibi labentes apponit candidus annos 3

Funde merum Genio.

Non tu prece poscis emaci,

Quae nisi seduetis nequeas committere divis3

At bona pars procerum tacita libabit acerra. 5¹
Haud cuivis promptum est murmurque humilesque susurros
Tollere de templis et aperto vivere voto,

your prayers, and to make a claim
which you dare not entrust to the
ear of the gods without first taking
them aside; yet a good part of our
great men can only sacrifice with
silent censer.’

1 Macrine] All that is known of
him is contained in the following
words of the Schol. Alloquitur Ma-
crinum, hominem sane eruditum et
paterno se affefflu dilzgentem, qui in
domo Servilii didicerat, a quo agellum
comparaverat indulto sibi pretio ali-
quanto.

hunc diem] The Romans were
scrupulous in the observanee of
their own and their friends’ birth-
days (cf. Hor. Carm. IV. 11. 17,
111. 17. 14, Tibul. lv, 5. 1). Prae
ceteris aulem die natali suo quisque
genio sacrificabat, et antiquo quidem
more vino tantum et tlznre. (Varro
apud Censorin. φ..)

meliore lapillo] a custom in use
amongst the Scythians and Thra-
cians (cf. Plin. VII. 40, 41), and
alluded to in Mart. V111. 45. 2, XII.
34. 5, IX. 53. 5 Felix utraque lux
diesque nobis 'Seguandi melioribus
lapillis.

2 apponit] Cf. Hor. Carm. 11. 5.
13 Currit enim ferox Aetas, et llll
quos tibi dempserit Aspona* annos.

candidus] (jk. λευκὴ ἡμέρα, used
(likestlz'x in the passage just quoted
from Martial) of a bright and auspi-
ct'ous dawn.

3 Genio] The tutelary Deity or
‘guardian angel ’ who was supposed
to attend on every individual from
the cradle to the grave. Its cultus
was strictly materialistic‚ and should
be compared with the offerings of

meat, drink, and clothes, which were
made to the manes of the dead. Cf.
Censorin. de die nat. 3, Serv. ad
Virg. Georg. Ι. 302, Hor. Ep. 11. 2.
187 Scit Genius, natale comes qui
temperat astrum, Naturae Deus lzu-
manae, mortalis in unum Quodque
caput, vultu mutabilis albus et ater.
In character it was the reflex of the
man (cf. Sat. VI. 48, where it repre-
sents the felicitas of the emperor),
it might be humoured and appeased
by proper attention, more especially
by sacrifice (cf. V. 151), or irritated
and made baneful by neglect (cf.
IV. ⁴27, Juv. Χ. 129). From these
latter passages it would appear to
represent the alter homo or ‘second
self.’

5 libabit] futurum in sententia
generali (Jahn).

Al. libavit with the sense of a fre-
quentative aoriSt, like deduxit in
Hor. Ep. 1. 2. 48 non aeras acervus
et auri Aegroto domino deduxit cor-
peresebres.

acerra] λιβάνωτις, a broad shal-
low cup in shape similar to the
patera, but used for incense as the
palera for wine and liquids. Cf.
Mart. x. 24. 5, Ov. Ep. iv. S. 39.

6 cuivis] τῴ τυχόντι. ‘It were
no easy task sor the ordinary man to
banish from his temples the whisper
and the niuttered sigh.' Jahn well
compares the following passages
from Sen. ex Athenod. (Azy). x.) Tunc
πίω esse te omnibns cupiditatibus
solumne, cum ιό μ’νῖίνῑινίζι· ut nisti!
deum reges nisi qaod regare possis
falam, and Nunc enim (flamm est
dementia hominum! turpissima vota
Dt'z's insusurrant: si quis admoverit
