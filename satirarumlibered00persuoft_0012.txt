dorus. An attempt has been made to prove that Luna
on the Gulf of Spezzia, and not Volaterrae, was his birth-
place. But a line in the Sixth Satire,

Lunai portum, est operae, cognOSClte cives!

is the only evidence in favour of Luna, and is virtually
nothing more than a compliment to the place as a
pleasant sea-side residence. On the other hand, in favour
of Volaterrae, independent of the express statement of
the grammarian, we have strong presumptive evidence in
the name of his mother Sisennia which is Etrurian, and
in a form of his own name (Aules) which appears in
most of the MSS (⁶ Etrusci autem Auli nomen sonabant
Aule’ Jahn), in the discovery at Volaterrae of inscriptions
bearing his family name, in the marriage of his kinswoman
Arria with Caecina whose family were natives of Vola-
terrae, in the unstudied allusions to Etruria which occur
constantly throughout the Satires, and finally in the
following verse, which Jahn refers to the X1vth century:

Duxit et inviotum Volaterris Persius agmen.

The biographer adds that he was a Roman eques
connected by blood and marriage with men of the
highest rank. At the age of six he was left a minor by
the death of his father Flaccus, after which his mother
married Fusius a Roman eques and, according to the
scholiast, selected Luna on the Gulf of Spezzia as her
place of residence, till the death of her second husband
which took place a few years afterwards. Persius re-
mained at Volaterrae until his twelfth year, and then
went to Rome to finish his studies under the grammarian
Remmius Palaemon and the rhetorician Virginius Flavus.
At the age of sixteen he made the acquaintance of the
Stoic Annaeus Cornutus, and never left him (ila ut nun-
quam ab eo discederet> up to the time of his own death,
which took place on the 24th of November Aa). 62, in
the consulship of Publius Marius and Asinius Gallus.
