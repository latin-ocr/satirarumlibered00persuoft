Iussit, et humana qua parte locatus es in re 3
Disce, nec invideas, quod multa fidelia putet
In locuplete penu, defensis pinguibus Umbris,
[Et piper et pernae, Marsi monumenta clientis,] 75
Menaque quod prima nondum defecerit orca.
Hic aliquis de gente hircosa centurionum
Dicat: Quod satis est sapio mihi 3 non ego curo
Esse quod Arcesilas aerumnosique Solones,
Obstipo capite et figentes lumine terram, 80

72 locatus es] τεταγμένος. Α
military metaphor. Cf. Soph. Antig.
670, δορός τ’ ἂν ἐν χειμῶνι προστε-
ταὙμένον.

73 multa fidelia] Juvenal (VII.
119 sqq.) describes similar payments
in kind sor lawyer’s services, and
like the maana, pszer, perna in the
present passage they consist chiefly
of home—grown produtsts of little
value.

74 pinguibus] sc. οἱ παχεῖς, di-
vites; cf. Mart. V11. 53.

76 orca] Gk. ὑρχή (Aristoph.
Vesp. 676), which is also used spe-
cially of a pickle-jar.

74—76] Here again, as in vv. 12
—14, we can discover, Ι think, evi-
dent traces of the duplex recensio ;
and the omission of one of the two
last lines (in all probability of ver.
75) seems advisable for precisely the
same reasons as were advanced in
the-case of the former passage. For
ver. 75 is exaetly similar in character
to ver. 13. It is little better than a
repetition of the preceding idea: it
breaks the flow and connection of
the lines, whereas if it be omitted
the position of quod in ver. 76 is as
artistic as that of queritur in ver. 14.
1 should therefore be inclined to
consider ver. 13 and again ver. 75
as the ‘ rough draughts’ srom which
the poet afterwards elaborated two

more polished verses (14 and 76).
[Ι had always held the above view

on the strength os the internnl evi-

dence, and arn confirmed in my “
opinion by finding that Mp. one of
the best MSS actually omits ver. 75.]

77] The parenthesis is prolonged
to ver. 87 by the introducstion of a
quiet sneer at the opponents of phi-
losophy. The imaginary antagonist
is well chosen, as the contemptos
these ‘ captains’ for all mental culti-
vation was notorious. (Cf. Sat. v. 1 89,
Hor. Sat. 1. 6. 73, Juv. XIV. 194 sq.)

77 hircosa] ‘unsavoury,’ cf. Cat.
Lxlx. 6. .

79 aerumnosi] ‘gloomy,' ‘care-
worn,’ a sweeping epithet which is
quite in keeping with the imaginary
speaker. The vague and illiterato
character of the censure may also
be suggested by the poet coupling
the names of two such different men
as Solon who lived about ΒΕ. 600,
and Arcesilaus (13.C. 200), who may
be regarded as the founder of the
New Academy.

80—85] ‘ As with head awry and
eyes fixed upon the ground they
inumble to themselves their whis-
pered thoughts in inoody silence.
and weigh their words with lip pro-
truded, while they ponder the while
on some old dotard's dream that
nothing can be produced out of no-
thing, nothing retum to nothing. Is
it this stuff that you grow pale over,
is this any reason sor fort-going a
moal?

80 obstipo] Cf. Hor. Sat. 11. 5.
