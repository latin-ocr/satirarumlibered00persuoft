SATIRA vi. 89

SATIRA VI.

CAESIUS BASSUS, to whom this Satire is addressed, had been the intimate
friend of Persius from his boyhood (‘a puero Persio conjunctissimus’ Pers.
Vz't.), in consideration of which he obtained permission to be the publisher
of the Satires after their revision by Annaeus Cornutus. He was himself a
lyric poet, and the following line is ascribed to him by Priscian: Calliope
prmceps saplenti psallemt ore. Quintilian speaks of him in terms of limited
praise, ‘Si quem adjicere velis (Horatio), erit Caesius Bassus, quem nuper
vidimus: sed eum longe praecedunt ingenia viventium,’ and, from what
Persius says of him, we may infer that his style was rough and severe
(tetricus), and that he affected obsolete words3 although Jahn considers that
the expression vetm‘um primordia vocum hztmdl'sse numeris means more
than this, and refers to a poem composed by Bassus on the ‘elements of
language’ (‘simplieius videtur de libro cogitare, qui veterum vocum ori-
gines numeris, i.e. versibus complexus sit⁷). More than this, he attempts
to prove that this work is possibly still extant in the shape of an anonymous
poem ‘ quod versibus heroicis de figuris orationis agit‚' and he has certainly
amassed a considerable amount of evidence in support of the theory, for it
is at any rate clear that a poem ‘ de metris' is often ascribed to one Caesius
Bassus by Maximus Victorinus, Terentianus Maurus, and others.

Amongst the more definite facts that are known about Bassus we must
notice the statement made by the scholiast to the effe& that he had a villa
in the neighbourhood of Vesuvius, and that he was destroyed with his
house by an eruption of the mountain. This was no doubt the celebrated
emption of A.D. 79, when Herculaneum and Pompeii were destroyed, and
the elder Pliny lost his lise. 1t has also been supposed that he is alluded to
by name in the description given by the younger Pliny of his uncle⁷s death
(Ep. VI. 16) in an almost hopelessly corrupt passage, which has been con-
jetfturally emended by Jahn as follows: Egredlebotur domo ; acczffit codi-
cillos Retz'na Caesia· Bassi imminente periculo exterriti, nam villa Vesuvio
subjacebat, nec ulla nisi navibusficga .“ ut se tanto dzkcrz'mine emjeret orabat.

Two questions of interest are raised in connection with the sixth and
last Satire:

(i) that of the birth-place of Persius, which has been supposed to be
Luna (now Spezzi) on the strength of Lunai portum, est operae,
cognoscite cives (ver. 9) ;

(ii) that of the completeness of the Satires as a whole, and os this Satire

in particular.
