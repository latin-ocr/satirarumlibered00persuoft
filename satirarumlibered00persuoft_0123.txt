SATIRA vr. 95

Curvus ob id minui senio, aut coenare sine uncto,
Et signum in vapida naso tetigisse lagena.
Discrepet his alius: geminos, horoscope, varo

Producis Genio.

Solis natalibus est qui

Tingat olus siccum muria vafer in calice empta, 20

Ipse sacrum irrorans patinae piper 3 hic bona dente

Grandia magnanimus peragit puer.

Utar ego, utar,

ver. 22. peragat 7.

passage there may be a secondary
allusion to the social condition of
Persius himself who was an eques,
and, as his biographer tells us,
sanguine et affinitate primi ordinis
viris coiy'undlus.
, 16 curvus ob id minui] Cf. αἶψα
’γὰρ ἐν κακότητι βροτοὶ καταγηράσ-
κουσιν (Hom. Od. T. 360).

sine uncto] Cf. Sat. 111. 102, and
especially Hor. Ars Poet. 422 Si
vero est umqum qui rec'le ponere
possit. With this picture of the
miser bending over his wine-jar to
see whether the seal has been tam-
pered with cf. Sat. IV. 29 sqq.‚ and
with vapida, used of wine spoilt by
being put into badly resined jars,
cf. Sat. V. 148 Veientanumque 771-
bellum Exhalat vapida laesum pice
sessilis obba ?

18 ms] lzinc Mael.‚ but liis well
denotes the party of which Persius
avows himself a follower, ‘Another
rnay have different tastes from a man
of my class,’ and cf. Hor. Sat. 1. 6.
9 3 Longe mea discrepat istis Et vox et
ratio.

horoscope] is the star os one's
nativity. Varo is here an expressive
word as it is used primarily of two
lines which, starting from a common
point, diverge afterwards in different
directions. For Genio cf. note on
Sat. 11.·3 and especially Hor. Ep.
11. 2. 187 Genius natale comes qui
temperatastrum, which contains pre-
cisely the same idea stated in the
converse form.

20, 2 1] For a similar condensation
of ideas cf. in particular Sat. ΙΙΙ. 61
Α n passim sequeris corvos testaque
lutoque? where, as in the present
passage, every word adds something
to the pic-ture. It is a birthday with
the miser <solis natalibus) and yet it
is only a dry cabbage (contr. Unge
puer caules, ver. 69) that he moistens
(tingat) with a cheap brine pickle
(muria) which he is cunning enough
to buy as he wants it by a cupful at
a time (in calice empta), while with
his own hands he sprinkles over it
the sacred pepper.

21 sacrum] i. e. sacred in his eyes
from being so expensive. Cf. Hoc
bene sit! (Sat. IV. 30) and sacris
saccis of the miser-'s money-bags
(Hor. Sat. Ι. 1. 70). To explain it,
as Jahn does, by the analogy of
ἃλς θεῖος, ἀλφίτου ἱεροῦ loses all the
force os the satire.

in calice empta] not as it is osten
translated, ‘in a bought cup‚’ which
adds nothing to the picture. lllztria
was the brine in which tunny was
pickled. ' For its cheapness‚ as com-
pared with the high price of the
more refined garum, cf. Mart. XIII.
103 A ntz'polz'tanz', fidvor, snm filia
tlzy71m'; Essem si scombri, mm tila
missa Jbrem.

22 magnanimus] like rebus sar-
titcr absumptis (Hor. Ep. Ι. 15. 26)
of one who ‘mns through a fine
property in reckless sashion.’ Its
position in the sentence, as Macleane
observes, marks puer as emphatic
