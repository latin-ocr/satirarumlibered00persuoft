Blaesus (Sat. 1. 85), and to the Attis of Nero (Sat. 1. 93
sqq·)· ’

After a careful consideration of the arguments ad-
vanced on both sides 1 must give in my firm adherence
to Macleane's theory, that it is the Sixth Satire to which
the remark of the biographer alludes, though Ι should
most certainly not print it as he has done with the
marks of incompleteness at the end, for the simple
reason that Ide not believe tlte end to be tlze urfim'slzedpart.
Granting the assumption that the last written satire is of
necessity the one left incomplete‚ Ι am perfectly un-
convinced by the two arguments on which Jahn relies
for proving the early date of our Sixth Satire and the
later date of the First. So little can be determined defi
nitely on the subject of the allusions to Nero that,
however we may use thern conjecturally to explain ob-
scure passages in the author, it would be altogether unsafe
to rely upon them for constructing a theory of dates ;
while, as regards Pedius, Ι have done my best in my
note on the passage to prove that he is not the per-
son whom Jahn thinks him to be. Add to which Ι can
see no trace of¹incompleteness in the first or indeed in
any of the Satires with the exception of the last, for
the fourth, short as it is, is perhaps not inadequately
treated when we consider the character of the subject
and the fa& that he was unable, through sear> of
Nero's anger, to press the parallel with Alcibiades
through all its details. But, as regards the Sixth Satire
the case is altogether different, and, whatever might
be proved as to the actual date of the poem, Ι
should still see in it the strongest internal evidence in
favour of Macleane’s theory. For, independent of the
statement of the biographer, it is impossible to read
the Satires as a whole without being conscious of a
marked difference in the style of the last as compared
with that os the other five. In the first place it is
