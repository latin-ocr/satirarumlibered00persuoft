INTRODUCTION. xiii

Dinomaches ego sum! suffla: sum candidus! esto:
Dum ne deterius sapiat pannucia Baucis
, Cum bene discincto cantaverit ocima vernae.
Sat. 1v. 20.
It is easy to estimate the influence of such views upon and their m-
the character of his Satires, and, as Stocker well re-ssiseg‘zi‘iissffifm

marks, ‘while he was making great proficiency in the
principles and paradoxes of the porch, Persius made
but little advancement in that knowledge which is so
essential to the Satirist‚ the knowledge of the world.
At the political degradation of his country he would
seem to have felt no indignati0n3 at least, he expresses
none. He dreams of no freedom but that enjoyed by
the followers of Zeus 3 and the tyrants with whom he
grapples are always those of the mind.' Writing from an
almost absolute seclusion against the vices of a society of
which he knew nothing, and with which he had renounced

all intercourse, he has produced a series of scholastic
dissertations rather than satires, of shadowy outlines

rather than flesh and blood realities. He has imitated it
is true the subjects of Lucilius, the language of Horace,
and the mechanism of the old comedy in the construction
of his Satires, but it is the form without the spirit, and
with this all similarity between himself and the ordinary
satirist ceases. The characters he introduces are names
and nothing more, types of a class rather than a repro-
duction of individuals, a Staius, Dama, Baucis, Natta or
Vulfennius, not Rufillus or Gorgonius. And that this is
the case he has himself tacitly admitted, for, when he
draws upon Horace as he does repeatedly for the name
of a character, he shews himself utterly regardless of its
antecedents, and with perfect complacency appropriates
for a spendlllrist a name which Horace had made syno-

nym'ous with a miser.

Such is unquestionably the character of four at any ἓιξῆςγεέ os

rate of the six Satires: with the remaining two however satire.
