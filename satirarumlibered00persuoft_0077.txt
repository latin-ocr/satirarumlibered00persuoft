SATIRA III.

Turgidus hic epulis atque albo ventre lavatur,
Gutture sulfureas lente exhalante mefites3

Sed tremor inter vina subit. calidumque trientem

Excutit e manibus, dentes crepuere retecti,

Uncta cadunt laxis tunc pulmentaria labris.

Hinc tuba, candelae, tandemque beatulus alto

Compositus lecto crassisque lutatus amomis

In portam rIgidos calces extendit: at illum

ver. 105. rigidas Mp. Br. Herm. ; rigidos Jahn, Macl. Koenig. Cf.
Schneider.‚ gramm. Lat. 11. p. 115 (Jahn).

100 Sed] Macleane translates:
‘N ay more' (se. without bathing‚
before he leaves the table) : which is
simply intolerable. The idea is: (He
may have disregarded these premo-
nitory symptoms), ‘but as he sits at
his wine a shivering comes over him
and strikes from his hand the cup of
warm negus.'

calidum] Cf. Mart. ΧΠ. 60. 7 ne
calda Sabello Desit, et ut liquidum
potet Alauda merum ,· and Juv. V. 6 3
Quando vocatus adest gelidae calidae-
que minister?

trientem] is the cu and the mixture
it contains. In stri aceuracy triens
could only be used of the latter,
although Martial (x. 49. 1) uses the
expression amethystinos trientes for
the cup itself. A sextarius was the
entire amount of the negus mixed:
the triens represented four cyathi of
this liquid, in other words a third
of the whole sextarius.

101 retecti] sc. from which the
gums have receded, ut solent in acri

febre (Jahn). But surely the expres-
sion laxis labris in the line following
suggests a simpler explanation.

102 pulmentaria] ‘dainties.' The
word seems like ὄψον to have passed
through. different phases of mean-
ing. It was used (i) for anything
quod cum pane seu pulte comedeba-
tur, Heind., (ii) for any highly sea-
soned dish; but ¹it never seems to

have been confined almost entirely
to one particular class of food like
ὄψον to fislz.

103] ‘Then come the trumpet
and the tapers3 and at last our happy
little friend laid out on a tall bier
and plastered with thick unguents
stretehes his stiff heels towards the
door, and citizens of yesterday's make
put on the cap of liberty and bear
him to the tomb.'

tuba, candelae] The tubicines
formed part of the regular funeral
ceremony (cf. Petr. 78, Serv. ad
Virg. Aen. VI. 218), but the can-
delae denote a special case to judge
from Seu. de tranq. 11 Τ otz‘es in
vicinia mea conclamatum est, toties
praeter limen immaturas exsequias
sax cereusque processit (Jahn).

beatulus] μακαρίτης, but ironieal
in this case. Jahn well compares
Quem cum beatum fuisse Sallustius
respondisset praefectus, intellexit occi-
sum (Arum. Marc. XXV. 3).

104' lutatus amomis] So Juv.
IV. 108 sudans Crispinus amomo
Quantum vix redolent duo statera,-
and Mart. xxv. 50. 1 ne lutet immun-
dum nitidos ceroma capillos.

105 In portam] ἀνὰ πρόθυρον τε-
τραμμένος, Hom. ll. T. 212. Cf. also
Pliny V11. 8. 6. Notice the use of
porta sor janua (the door of the
atrium) and contr. Ov. Am. 1. 9.
