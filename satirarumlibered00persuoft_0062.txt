SATIRA ΙΙΙ.

Video meliora probeque, deteriora sequor is, in brief, the substance οἴ the
present Satire. Itis directed against those who, in spite of a sound phi-
losophical education, fail in after life to act up to the teaching they have
received. In the case of such men their knowledge becomes their punish-
ment, for they can appreciate the value of true happiness though they will
not make the necessary effort to secure it but, from want of principle or
weakness of character, sin on until their case is hopeless and only remorse
is left them.

Macleane divides the Satire into two parts, the first and less general os
whi‘ch he supposes to end with ver. 43. But the pupil who appears in the
opening lines is most certainly the person addressed in vv. 58-— 62 3 conse-
quently the division (supposing any such to exist) must be placed later on
in the Satire, say for instance at ver. 63. Later than this it is impossible to
place it as ver. 88 is immediately connected with ver. 65, the parenthesis
which intervenes being devoted to the scientific treatment 01⁴ the moral
plague before it has become incurable. But in reality Ι can see no trac<-
os any such division, sor the poem is equally general, equally unlike a true
satire, from first to last. The pupil in question is simply the type of a
class, introduced, as occasion requires, to give definiteness to the picture.
Having no actual existence he may be intended to represent in his person
the close no less than the commencernent of such a career—the final death
of all moral principle no less than the youthful solly of which it is the
result. The Satire naturally arranges itself under the following heads :

1—6‚ A professor of the Stoic school finds a pupil asleep at midday,

7—14, who starts up in a rago and by his irritation shows his indo-
lence and inipatience os control.

15-30, The master takes him to task as an overgrown baby, when he
proceeds to excuse himself from work on thc ground that his nmterials arc
bad (ver. 19), that he has great expectations (ver. 25), that he comcs os
a good family (ver. 28 sq).

31-43, The remorse which he will feel in later lise when hc finds out
the value os all he has lost.

44-51, True (says the master) 1 wasted a good deal of time like other
boys· when 1 was young,
