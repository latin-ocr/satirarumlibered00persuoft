SATIRA 11. 25

Mens bona, fama, fides! haec clare et ut audiat hospes,
Illa sibi introrsum et sub lingua immurmurat: Ο si
Ebulliat patruus, praeclarum funus! et: O si 10
Sub rastro crepet argenti mihi seria dextro

Hercule! pupillumve utinam, quem proximus heres
Impello, expungam! namque est scabiosus, et acri

8— 16] ‘A sound mind, faz'rfizme,
good credit: this aloud for the by-
stander's ear: but inwardly and with
bated breath he whispers another
prayer, O tlzat my uncle ‘zoould
breatlle llis last, llisficueral should be
grand! and O tlzat by the favour os
Hercules I could lzear a pot of money

I could strike my ward out of tlte

Here’s Nm'ns taking llome lzis third
wife! That you may offer these
prayers with a clear conscience you
plunge your head at dawn two and
three times over in Tiber's stream,
and wash away the dreams of the
night in the running water.'

8 hospes] a general term of greet-
ing. Cf. Catul. IV. 1, where it means
no more than ‘my friends and neigh-
bours.’

10 Ebumat] So Jahn, Herm.;
Ebullit aL, quae forma difficilis expli-
catu est (Jahn). For the expression
ebullire [sc. animam] cf. Petron. 42,
where the context seems to mark it
as a phrase drawn from low life,
like excutere oristas (ΙΙΙ. 115). The
lit. meaning is to ‘boil or bubble

away,‘’ which may refer specially to
the wasting away of the body 011
the funeral pyre, or else, with more
probability, to the a& of ‘breath-
ing one’s last.’ Cf. Shaks. Isz'ng

patruus] The uncle was prover-
bially strici: (cf. Ι. 11') and, in this
case, probably wealthy. Notice in
particular the art with which the
iniquity of these prayers is veiled.
The uncle is to be honoured after
death with a splendid funeral: the
ward is scrofulous, and death will
only be a welcome release to him:
while the happiness of Nerius in
securing a third dowry is rather im-
plied than expressed.

11] Cf. Hor. Sat. 11. 6. 10 0 sc'
urnam argenti fhrs quoe milli mon-
stret, ut illi Thesauro invento qui
mercenarius agrum Illum {fisum
mercatus oravit, dives amico Hercule.

12 proximus heres] sc. as the
heres substitutus or lzeres secundo
gradu, which is thus explained by
Jahn: Tenendum est ex lege tabularum
iis, quibus testamento tutor datus nou
sit, agnatum legitimum esse tutorem,
eundem igitur pupilli, si decesserit,
heredemfuturum. Cf. Hor. Sat. ΙΙ.

where the past tense: ‘has displaced
or supplanted.’

may mean ‘out of the lists of the
living‚' but more probably ‘out of
