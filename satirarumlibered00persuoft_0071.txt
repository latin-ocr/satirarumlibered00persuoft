SATIRA III. 43

Haud tibi inexpertum curvos deprendere mores,

Quaeque docet sapiens braccatis illita Medis

Porticus, insomnis quibus et detonsa iuventus

Invigilat, siliquis et grandi pasta polenta3 55
Et tibi quae Sarnios diduxit littera ramos

Surgentem dextro monstravit limite callem.

ver. 56. deduxit Mp. Bi. Herm.; diduxit Jahn, Macl. Koenig.

52 curvos mores] See note on
curva Sat. IV. 12. Cf. also Sat. V.
38, and Hor. Ep. 11. 2. 44 Curvo
dignoscere rec‘tum.

53 Quaeque docet] depends on

an infinitive which we may easily
supply by zeugma from deprendere.
This is better than to refer it imme-
diately to inexpertum [sc. illorum]
auae ἃς.
’ sapiens Porticus] ‘H ποικίλη Στοοί
in which Zeno had taught, in con-
sequence of which it is here put
generally for the Stoic Philosophy.
It was situated in the Ceramicus at
Athens and had been frescoed by
Polygnotus, Mycon and Panaenus,
eminebat autem inter quatuor pistu-
να.)- pugna fllaratlzom'aca (Jahn).
Cf. Corn. Nep. Ι. 6.

braccatis] Braccae are the Greek
ἀναξὺριδες or θύλακοι (Arist. Vesp.
1087) barbarorum, imprimis Pcr-
sarum, insigne vestimentum (Jahn).

54 quibus] Macl. by a curious
blunder refers this to the paintings
instead of the doaerines of the school.

detonsa] the opposite of κομᾶν
which latter was regarded by the
Stoies as a sign of luxury and ef-
feminacy. The same badge of their
profession was adopted by the Puri-
tans in modern times.

55 polenta] The Greek equiva-
lent for the Roman puls. It was
the simplest of diets. Cf. Sen. Ep.
XLV. 11 Habamus aquam, habemns
polentam .· Jovi ipsi controversiam de
felicitate fizciamus (Jahn). Cf. also
vivit siliquis et pane secundo (Hor.
Ep. 11. 1. 123).

56 diduxit] deduxit, Herm. But
the confusion of Mss between di
and de in composition is so hopeless
that, as Jahn says, scribendum est
quod sensus postulat etiam renitenti-
bus libris. Cf. Lachm. ad Propert.

. 175.

littera] The charaeter *f (the old
form of the Greek T) was chosen by
the Pythagorenns as the symbol of
human life. The stem represents
the early eriod os youth in which
the charadt'er is stin unformed: the
left-hand branch denotes the easy
path of vice, the other the steep and
difficult ascent to virtue. Cf. Pers.
Sat. V. 34, Auson. Eid. ΧΠ. de litt.
Menos. 9 Pythagorae bivium ramis
patet ambiguis '1¹3 also Serv. Virg.
Am. VI. 136, and the following
verses from the Anthol. Lat. Littera
Ri’tllagorae discrimine seda bicorni
Humanae vitae speciem praeferre
videtur. Μῖνι via virtutz‘s dextrum
petit ardua callem, Difficilemque
aditum primum spestantibus ffrt,
red requiem praebet fl'ssis in vertice
summo. Molle ostentat iter via lata,
sed ultima meta Praecipitat captos
volvitque per aspere saxa.

The above is Jahn's explanation.
Muclemre, apparently from inability
to reconcile the story with the later
somn of the Greek T, regards the
device as of very late origin and
‘derived from the Latin Y which
suits it better than the Greek.'

ramos] ramo Mael. but in de-
fiance of Mss and editors. The ac-
cusative may be partly explained by
supposing that Samios is made to
