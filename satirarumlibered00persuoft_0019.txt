INTRODUCTION. xv

Prologue and again in the commencement of the First
Satire‚ which can only be satisfactorily accounted for
by the theory that lie had reason to dread N ero’s anger
and wished to escape detection ς

(ii) The expressions calve and pinguis aqualiculus in
vv. 55, 56, the latter of which exactly corresponds with
the ‘fuit ventre projecto' in the description given by
Suetonius (Nero 51) of that emperor's personal appear-
ance, while the Scholiast on Lucan Ι. 53 considers that
he is also referred to in calvus, though Jahn adds ‘non
dubito quin Schol., qui Neronem a Lucano traduci sibi
persuaserat, in animo habuerit Juvenalis (IV. 38) calvum
lVeronem, qui tot errores procreavit 3’

(iii) The fact that Nero's earliest effusions were
all in Greek <compare Philostr. Apol. Z’yczn. 1v. 39
with nugari solitos Graece, ver. 70),- that he wrote an
Ἰλίου ἅλωσις or Τρωϊκά which may be alluded to in
Iliade (ver. 123), and that he consulted Cornutus on
an intended epic (compare Dion Cass. LXII. 29 with
heroas sensus afferre, ver. 69) 3 that (in the words of
‘the same author LXI. 20) ἐκιθαρῴδησέ τε ’Άττιν nvo) ἢ
Βάγχας ὁ Αὔγουστος, with which compare the subjeci: of
the lines satirized in ver. 93 and vv. 99—-1023 lastly
that the style and character of the quotations resemble
the fragments of Nero's poetry which have corne down to

us, sor instance

Colla Cytheriacae splendent agitata columbae.
(Sen. Quaest. Nat. 1. 5.)

I have reserved for final consideration a passage
which in itself appears to me almost conclusive upon the
subject. I allude to vv. 99—102,

Torva Mimalloneis implerunt cornua bombis,
Et raptum vitulo caput ablatura superbo
Bassaris, et lyncem Maenas flexura corymbis
Evion ingeminat: reparabilis adsonat Echo.
