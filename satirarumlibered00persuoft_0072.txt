44 A. PERSII vFLACCI

Stertis adhuc, laxumque caput ‚compage soluta

Oscita‘c hesternum, dissutis undique malis!

Est aliquid quo tendis, et in quo dirigis arcum? 60
An passim sequeris corvos testaque lutoque,

Securus quo pes ferat, atque ex tempore vivis?
Helleborum frustra, quum iarn cutis aegra tumebit,
Poscentes videas: venienti occurrite morbo,

ver. 60. in quod Jahn, Koenig3 in quo Mp. Bt. Herm. Mael.

agree with ramos instead of with
littera by hypallage.

58 stertis] The lines which
follow contain the serious applica-
tion of -the lesson, the soree of which
is much weakened by introducing a
note of interrogation after adhuc.

60—62] An amplification, as
Jahn well remarks, of the Greek
proverb τοὶ πετόμενα διώκειν; cf.
διώκει παῖς ποτανὸν ὄρνιν (Aesch.
Agam.). Each word in the sentence
is carefully selected. Thus the chase
is a random one (passim), the object
worthless (corvos), the weapon any-
thing that comes first to hand (scs-
taque lutoque).

60 in quo] in quod Jahn, who
adds, hoc quod gy‘ammalica poslztlat
etiam invitis codd. mutatione revera
nulla reducendum foret. But in qno
is neater in the present passage, and
well denotes the ‘covering of an ob-
ject' in taking aim.

62 ex tempore] ‘For the mo-
ment‚’ ‘from hand to mouth.’

63] At this point the comparison
begins 'between physical and moral
sickness which is taken up and corn-
pleted at ver. 88. It is broken off at
ver. 6 5 as the words venienti occm'rilc
morbo suggest a digression on the
subjecst of the proper remedius.

Helleborum] There were two
kinds, the white and the blaek helle-
bore (Cf. Aul. Gell. XV11. 15). It
was the latter which was thought to
be beneficial in dropsical cases (Plin.

XXV. 5. 22).

64 occurrite] Cf. 1. 62 and Ov.
Rem. Amor. 91 Principiis obsta.

65] ⁶ Meet the disease as it comes
and then what need to promise
mountains of gold to Craterus?'
(Jahn). Macleane and others place
a colon at morbo and translate ‘Or
else what good is it to call in Cra-
terus (when the case is desperate) ‘3’
But this reference to the hopeless
stage os the disease is premature
when it is the remedies that are
being suggested.

Cratero] a celebrated physician
mentioned by· Cic. (ad Att. XII. 13.
13 14. 4), whose daughter he at-
tended, and also by Horace (Sat. 11.
3. 161 Craterum dertlrse putato).
He was a Greek by birth and is
said to have been the physician of
Augustus. Here however the name
is used quite generally.

magnos montes] so Juv. xn. 1²9
silentibus aurum exaequet. Cf. also
Ter.lerm. Ι. 2. 18 modo non montes
altri pollicens, and Plaut. Mil. δίον,
IV. 2. 7 3 Argenti montes uon massas
habel.

Stoic Philosophy which follows cf.
