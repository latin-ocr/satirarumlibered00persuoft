8 A. PERsu FLAccr

Elevet‚ accedas, examenve‘ improbum in illa

Castiges trutina, nec te quaesiveris extra.
Nam Romae quis non—? ah si fas dicere! sed fas;

Tunc, quum ad canitiem et nostrum istud vivere-triste

Aspexi ac nucibus facimus quaecumque relictis 10
Quum sapimus patruos, tunc, tunc, ignoscite—“ n010.’'
Quid faciam? sed sum petulanti splene cachinno.

Scribimus inclusi, numeros ille, hic pede liber,

lari trutina examinantur, while, in
Satire V. 101, examen is specially
used of the more delicate instru-
ment (statera). On the other hand
Jahn, followed by Macleane, would
make both the examen and the tru-
tina part of the common scale and
translate ‘ Don't you attempt to cor-
rec⁰t the erring tongue in the people's
balance,' an idea which is foreign
to the whole context, as the original
advice was ‘Hold to your own opi-
ni0n‚' not ‘Try to force the opinion
of the world.’

8-12] Iu the following lines 1
heartily concur with Jahn and Mac-
Ieane who assign nolo (ver. 1 1) to the
critic instead of to Persius, and read
the next line as given in the text.
The entire passage may then be
translated thus ; ‘ For at Rome who
is not—⁴? O that I might only say
the word! nay, I may say it now
that Ι consider my grey hairs and
this ascetic life Ι lead and the pur-
suits Ι follow since I put away child-
ish amusements, now when I feel
burning within me the wisdom of
the uncle, now, now do pray permit
me. ‘ Impossible' you answer.
Then what am Ι to do? For I am
mirthful and of a satirical humour.'

8 quis non] ‘tongue-tied to Nero'
(whether from sear or the hope of
suture favour) is what he would pro-

bably have added had his friend
allowed him.

9 istud vivere] τὸ ζῆν τοῦτο. This
particular instance of the infinitive
used for the substantive is noticed
by Quintilian VI. 38. Cf. also scire
tuum, ridere meum in this satire,
(ver. 27, 122).

This pretended asceticism and
canities would give Persius a
claim to rebuke the young, whil'e it
npght screen him from the notice
o Nero.

10 nucibus] the boys' substitute
sor dice, which latter they were not
allowed to use. Cf. Hor. Sat. ΙΙ. 3.
171, and Martial V. 84. 1, Jam
lrz'slz's nucibus puer relietis Clamoso
revocatur a magatro.

11 patruos] Like the noverca, the
patruus was proverbial sor severity.
Cf. Sat. 11. 10, where the nephew
prays to be rid of him; also Hor.
Sat. 11. 3, 88„ Carm. 111. 12. 3 &e

nolo] Herm. reads the line thus

tunc, tunc—Ignoscite, nol0,· Quid

faciam? secl sum petulanti splene-—

cachinno ; but nolo can hardly be
assigned to Persius, whose eager-
ness to obtain the required permis—
sion is manifest, though he pretends
to place the decision in his oppo-
nent’s hands. Add to which the
position of sed is rendered ex-
tremely awkward by the change,
