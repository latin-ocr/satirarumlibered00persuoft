Et quid opus Cratero magnos promittere montes? 65
Discite, o miseri, et causascognoscite rerum:

Quid sumus, et quidnam victuri gignimu13 ordo

Quis modus argento, quid fas optare, quid asper

Utile nummus habet3 patriae carisque propinquis 70
Quantum elargiri deceat3 quem te deus esse

causas rerum] In allusion pro-
bably to the primary doctrine of the
Stoics duo esse in rerum natura, ex
quillus omnia fiant, causam et ma·
teriam (Sen. Ep. LXV. 2). So again
in Cic. de Off II. 2. 5. Sapientia
autem est (ut a veteribus philosophis
definitum est) rerum divinarum ct
humanarum causarumque quibus lure
res continentur, scientia. Cf. also
Yirg. Georg. II. 490 Felix qui potuit
rerum cognoscere causas. (Jahn.)

67—76] ‘ What we are and what
life we are born to lead3 what place
has been assigned to us, where and
at what point we are to begin gcntly
to round the goal ; what is the liniit
to collecting plate, what prayers
are consistent with piety; what is
the use of coined money, and how
much of it should be freely given up
sor your country and your s1·iends;
in a word, what sort of person the
Deity has ordained you to be and in
what part os the human commonalty
your station has been assigned you.
Learn all this, and never bear a
grudge because jars of provisions are
wasting in the rich man’s cupboard,
the retaining-sees of wealthy Um-
brian clients ; together with peppcr
and hams, thank-offerings from sorne
Marsian dependant, or because the
sprats he received in the first jar
have yet to be consumed.’

67 Quid sumus] So Arrian dszs.
II. 10 Σκέψαι τίς εἶ, and again in
I. 6. 25ὀύκ αἰσθήσεσθε τοίνυν οὔτε
τίνες ἐστέ, οὔτε ἐπὶ τῖ”γεΎόνατε οὔτε
τί τοῦτ’ ἔστιν ἐφ’ ὂ τὴν θέαν παρειλή-
φατε.

ordo] This word introduces an
illustration from the chariot—race.
Orda is the place assigned to us at
the starting-point, called linu'nis
orda (Stat. Theb. VI. 390). It was
decided by lot. Cf. Soph. Elec. 710
κλήροις ἔπηλαν καὶ κατέστησαν δι’·
φρους.

68 metae mollis flexus] ‘The
turning of the meta was a matter of
difficulty, and here accordingly it
represents any critical point in the
race of lifes (Macl.) Cf. Soph. Elec.
720 sqq„ Hom. Il. XXIII. 337 sqq.

69 argento] ‘Plate’ as it is ap·
parently opposed to asper nummus
:rough (because stamped) coin.
Itmay however refer inore general-
ly to all umvined silver. Jahn limits
the sense of asper to ‘ ncwrsv-coined
money,' but so nice a distinc⁶tion is
out of place in this passage.

71 elargiri] an allusion to the
Stoic doctrine of Charity (afficiam)
which is discussed at length in Sat.
VI. 27 sq. Jahn well compares
Lucil. Commoda praeterea patriae
sibi prima putare Deinde parentum,
lerlia jam postremaque nostra.
