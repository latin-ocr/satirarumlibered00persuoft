vi PREFACE.

in a less degree upon Koenig >and Hermann, while
I am indebted likewise to the following authors: Sir
Alexander Grant (Essay 072 tlte Stoic Philosophy);
Martha (Les flfforalz'stes Remmium->3 Friedlander (Moeurs
Romaiues, Trad. par Vogel).

Above all, my best thanks are due to my friend
Mr Paley, who most kindly volunteered to read over
my sheets for the press‚ and several suggestions which
he has made will be found introduced into the body
of the notes.

In conclusion, let me anticipate an objection which
will no doubt be raised against the practice of imbed-
ding pieces of translation in the notes to an author.
In the first place slight difficulties are often explained
more clearly by a translation than by a note, but,
more than this, I shall hardly be accused of undertaking
the defence of all Bolin's series when Ι give it as my
firm belief that an accurate translation never yet injured
a boy's scholarship. With ordinary care on the part
of a master it need never screen an indolent Pupil,
while it is often a great encouragement to a pains-
taking boy whose work is just too difficult for him,
and saves him from numberless misconceptions of an
author's meaning, which, if accepted as first impressions‚
are afterwards so difficult to correct. Many a candi-
date for University honours has found it a far harder
task to unlcarn his Horace and Virgil than to master

a new and difficult author.
