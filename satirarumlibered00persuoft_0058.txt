Rem struere exoptas caeso bove, Mercuriumque

Arcessis fibra: da fortunare Penates, 4 5
Da pecus et gregibus fetum! quo, pessime, pac'to,

Tot tibi quum in flammas iunicum omenta liquescant?

At tamen hic extis et opimo vincere ferto

Intendit: iam crescit ager, iam crescit ovile,

lam dabitur, iam iam! donec, deceptus et exspes, 50
Nequicquam: fundo, suspiret, nummus in imo!

ver. 47. flammis γ.

44 Mercuriumque] He invokes
Mercury as the god by whom riches
were bestowed (κερδῷος), a character
in which he is often represented with
a purse in his hand (cf. Sat. VI. 62).
At the same time, as Jahn remarks,
there is no doubt a secondary allu-
sion here to his special attributes of
ἐπιμήλιος, νόμιος (Aristoph. T hesm.
977), under which he was worship-
ped by peasants and shepherds. (Cf.
Hom. Od. ξ. 435, Il. ξ. 491.)

51 nequicquam] For the general
sense of the passage cf. δειλὴ δ’ ἐνὶ
πυθμένι φειδώ (Hes. ’'Epy. καὶ 'HJ-c.
369), an idea which has been repro-
duced by Seneca in Ep. Ι. 4 Sera
parsimonia infundo est. The actual
arrangement of the line is a sar more
difficult question, and, in a case
where no two editors are agreed, I
have ventured to propose the one
given in the text.

Among others which have been
proposed are the following:

(i) Jahn, donec deceptus et exspes:
sVeqm'cquam fundo, suspiret, num-
mus in imo!

(ii) Macl. donec deceptus et exspes
Nequicquam fundo suspiret nummus
ln imo.

(iii) Herm. donec deceptus et exspes
Nequicquam: fiendo, suspiret, num-
mus zn imo! but the pos sition of
nequicquam is made so intolerably
weak by this punctuation that I have
not hesitatcd to rejetst it.

(iv) Mr Paley suggests to me the
following, which gives a very effec-

tive line: donec deceptus et exspes
Nequicquam fundo nummus suspi-
ret in imo.

52 pingui] is a generic epithet,
derived from the appearance of gold.
Cf. pingue ebur.

incusa auro] refers probably to
the chrysendeta or parcel-gilt plate
so commonly alluded to in Martia]
(cf. 11. 43. 11, xiv. 97, &c.).

Jahn however would make incusa
= the Gk. ἔμπαιστα, and explains it
thus: Vasa e pretioso¹ metallo sada
cum anaglyphis ornari 'soler ent ,potuit
hoc diverso modo fieri, aut ita ut ex
ipso metallo caelo vel malleo elabora-
rentur figurae, cujus genem's haud
pauca hodieque supersunt vasa, aut
anaglypha seorsim perfecta extrinse-
cus adderenter vasculis quae crustae
vel emblemata dicebantur (Cic. Vetr .
IV. 2 3. 52) ; quod hoc modo ornatum
erat, dicebatur ἔμπαιστον, incusum.
Exemplo sit patera aurea apud Mil-
linum (Alon. Ined. Ι. 22⁷. 5) cui inserti
sunt emblematum loco nummi am‘ei.

54 excutiat] excutias Jahn, Herm.
A reading which breaks off the sen-
tence awkwardly, while it produces
a jingle most unpleasing to the ear.
Add to which it is hypercriticism‚
in poetry more particularly, to say
that cor and pedore laevo aie tauto-
logous in the following translation,

‘Your heart in an eager flutter of
excited Joy would drive the life· drops
from your left breastff He alludes
to the faintness produced by any
violent excitement. Cf. Virg. Georg.
