SATIRA v. 63

Si quibus aut Prognes, aut si quibus olla Thyestae

F ervebit‚ saepe insulso coenanda Glyconi 3

Tu neque anhelanti, coquitur dum massa camino, 10
Folle premis ventos, nee clauso murmure raucus

Nescio quid tecum grave cornicaris inepte,

Nec stloppo tumidas intendis rumpere buccas.

Verba togae sequeris iunctura callidus acri,

served up time aster time for some
insipid Glycon.'

offas] Cf. subitas cffellas (Mart. ),
a ‘ hastily prepared cutlet.'

6 Ingeris] Gk. ἐντίθεσαι (cf.
ἐνθοῦ Aristoph. Eq. 51, ‘ Put it into
your mouth⁷). The idea is that the
poetry which is swallowed by the
mouth will tend to nourish the hrain.
For examples of this materialism cf.
note on vaporata aure (Sat. Ι. 126)
and καταπιὼν Εὐριπίδην (Aristoph.
Acharn. 484) ‘having sortified your-
self with Euripidesf Others have
proposed to translate ingeris, ‘do you
foist upon us Τ or ‘are you throwing
to us? (cf. ingere rixanti populo, ver.
177). The explanation I have a·
dopted‚ that poetry is to the poet
what the strengthening (robusti) food
of the training school is to the
gladiator, was suggested to ine by
Mr Paley.

7 nebulas Helicone legunto] like
nubes et inania captet (Hor. Ars
Post. 230).

8 olla fervebit] like aristas estta-
tere (111. 115) is one of the verba
togae which Persius may possibly
have derived from Sophron or some
other writer of mimes. It means
no more than to ‘tell anew the tale
οἱ the supper served up by Progne to
Tereus, or by Atreus to Thyestes]

9 insulso] I should much prefer
to take this word generally like
maesto· tragoedo (ver. 3) and stupidi
collega Corinthi (Juv. V111. 197), but
the Schol. describes Glycon in par-
ticular as nescius jocari, propter quen.l
eum insulsum peu-sins dixit.

11 premis ventos] ‘ You are not
the man to squeeze out the wind
from the panting bellows.' This
nietaphor of ‘casting' poetry like
iron is found in Juv. VII. 110, Tunc
immensa cavi spirant mendacia fol-
les,· and again in Hor. Sat. Ι. 4. 19,
At tu conclusos hircinis follibus au-
ras, Usque laborantes dum ferrum
molliat ignis, ut mavis imitare, from
which latter passage the lines in the
text are probably imitated.

11 clauso murmure raucus]
‘ hoarse with pent-up murmurs,' an
idea which is repeated in cornicaris
‘to croak like a raven.' Cf. 111. 81,
and the following passages which
Jahn quotes from St Jerome, Intra
se nescio qnid cornicantes, and again
Cava verba ct in modum vesicarum
tumentia buccis trutinantur inflatis.

13 stloppo] denotes the explosion
of the poetic bombast which in the
two last lines has been represented
as gathering, ‘ut pueri dum buccas
tumidas summa vi inflatas sssoppo,
quod verbum ad sonitum exprimen-
dum fimum est, rumpunt, ut sonum
emittant) (Jahn).

14—18] ‘The language of the
people is your aim and objeo't, the
art that is shown in a well-construet-
ed verse, a polished but not extra-
vagant dietim, a elever hand for
rasping guilty morals and for post-
ing up a fault with honest satire.
From these sources draw your themes,
and leave at Mycenae the feast, head,
feet and all, while you confine your·
sels to humbler meals.'
