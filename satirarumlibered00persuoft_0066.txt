Poscis et iratus mammae lallare recusas?—

An tali studeam calamo?-Cui verba? quid istas

Succinis ambages? tibi luditur3 effluis amens 3 20
Contemnere: sonat vitium percussa, maligne

Respondet viridi non cocta fidelia limo.

18 mammae lallare] This is better
than joining iratus mammae, ‘angry
with the breast! Cf. Varro, Cato
vel de lib. educ„ Cum cibum ac po-
tionem buas ac papas dicunt et ma—
trem mammam, patrem latam (Jahn).
For the infin. cf. vivere triste 1. 9.

19—24] ‘Is it likely tlzat J can
write witlz a pen like this? Whom,
think you, do you deceive? Why
harp upon these excuses? The stake
is your own; you are crazed and
running to waste3 you will be re-
jeoted, like an ill-baked jar of un-
tempered clay which, if you strike
it, betrays the flaw by the deadness
of its ring. You are in faci: wet
and soft clay: now, now you must
be worked apace and steadily
moulded into shape under the rapid
wheeL'

19 calamo] so culpantur frustra
salami, Hor. Sat. ΙΙ. 3. 7.

Cui verba] sub. das, ‘ VVhom (lo
you deceive? [sc. not me, but your-
seffl] Dare verba is to give a person
‘ words and nothing more.’ Cf.
Plaut. Epid. 1. 1. 88, 1v. 2. 85, and
passim.

20 succinis] Gk. ὑπᾴδειν, one of
the many words in this passage
which suggest the imitation of some
Greek original. It is literally to
‘sing to an iustrument' and so to
‘chime in with' another person as
in Hor. Ep.1. 17. 48. This accom-
pauiment would adopt an undertone
which brings us to the meaning in
the present assage ‘to whine.'

effluis] k. ἐκχεΐσθαι, used in
anticipation of the simile which fol-
lows. Cf. Plenus rimarum sum:

huc atque illuc perfluo, Ter. Eun. Ι.
2. 25.

21 contemnere] Gk. ἀποδοκιμάζειν,
‘to reject on test.' Cf. Geopon. VJ.
3. 2 Τινὲς μὲν οὖν ἀρκοῦνται τῇ δοκι·
μασίᾳ τοῦ καλῶς κεκεραμευμένου πί-
θου τῷ κρουσθέντα, αὐτὸν ἀποδοῦναι
ἦχόν τινα ὀξὺν καὶ τορὸν (Jahn).
‘Faken in this sense the word is
suitable enough, though Jahn agrees
with the Schol. who calls it male
translata ab Horatio (Sat. 11. 3. 14).

sonat vinum] The opposite of
solidum crepat, Sat. V. ἰ 5. For the
construetion cf. Virg. Aen. Ι. 328
nec vax hominem sonat, and Aristoph.
Achar. 933 ψοφεῖ λάλον καὶ ’πυρορ-
ραὙές.

maligne] used os things which
fall short of the purpose for which
they were destined; so colles ma-
lig-m· (zstm'les) Virg. Gew'g. 11. 179.

22 viridi] Gk. χλωρός. It is·
equivalent to crudus, ⁴ untempered‚'
and is no mere repetition of non
caela.

ε» 3 properandus] So JuV. [ν. ¹34
Arg-Mam atque rotam cilius propc-
rate.

24, 25] ‘ But your father's estate,
you say, supplies you with a compe-
tency: you have besides a family
saltcellar stainless and unsullied
(what need for sear Ρ) : add to which
a paten that duly pays its tribute to
the hearth and never dreams of
wantl’

25 far modicum] like rnrej‘alcr-
na, salinum and puella, is intended
to eonvey the idea of primitive sim-
plicity. If the owner would but
add to these the one thing needful
