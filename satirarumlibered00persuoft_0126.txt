trodudtion of a new speaker) but of
the original opponent who is sup-
posed to speak generally up to this
time and now deals a home thrust at
Persius: ‘Do you mean to say,
Persius, that you would thus break
up your property while hearty and
strong (instead of waiting to be-
queath it by will on your death-
bed)?’ Cf. the precisely similar
passage in Sat.. Ι, 28 At pulcrum est
digito monstrari et dicier hic est!
T en' cirratorum centum distata fuisse
Pro nihilo pendas? which is almost
conclusive on the point. By this
reading and translation the abrupt-
ness of the passage is considerably
lessened, as no new speaker is intro-
duced with the exception of Bestius
who suitably enough throws in a
word to second this utilitarian advice.
For the same reason Ι have not
hesitated to retain ‘ T une bona in-
columis minuas?⁷ in its present place
in line 37, as the transposition of
this and verse 41 ‘ffizec cinere ulterior
metuas? ’‚ which is adopted by Her-
mann, renders the word at which
follows inexplicable, necessitates the
introduction of a new speaker (sc.
Persius himself) and adds to the
abruptness which we are attempting
to explain.

37 Bestius urget] The position of
ct proves that Bestius is a new party
to the diangue, and not the original
antagonist: ‘add to which Bestius
presses our Greek philosophers hard:
T liat's just tlte way ; ever since tliis
emasculate philosophy was imparted
into tlte city witlz its pepper and dates
our very reapers have tainted their
pottage witlz thick oil.'

Bestius] The correc'ior Bestius os
Horace (Ep. Ι. 15. 37), who is in-

troduced to play the same part as
the military captain in Sat. Ι. 1¹27,
111. 77, V. 189, and delivers his un-
reasoning invective against Greek
learning, as exemplified in the Stoic
doctrine of Charity.

38 sapere hoo] like nostrum istud
vivere triste (Sat. Ι. 9).

39 cum pipere et palmis] sc.
from Syria, here put for the East
generally. Cf. Jam pridem Syrus
in Tiberim defluxit Orontes (Juv. ΙΙΙ.
62) and advectus Romam quo pruna
ct cottana vento (ΙΙΙ. 8 3).

palmis] ‘dates‚’ not ‘
for the plural would be out of place
if the latter were intended as Jahn
suggests.

maris expers] is unquestionably
‘emasculate‚' as Casaubon under-
stands it (cf. Sat. 1. 103, 104 Si testiculi
vena ulla paterni Viveret in nobis and
Summa delumbe saliva Ηοι· natat),
an epithet which admirably sums up
the moral and literary condition of
Rome at the period of which the

palm-oil‚'

Satirist is writing. The whole of
Persius is nothing but one long de-
nunciation against the ‘ shams’ then
prevalent in every department of
art and morality‚ while Seneca and
other writers add their testimony
that in poetry, oratory, philosophy,
and religion it was as a rule the
shadow and not the substance that
was courted.

Jahn, Macleane and others scout
this simple and natural interpreta-
tion, and, proceeding on the assump-
tion that because Persius frequently
reproduces Horace therefore he must
always do so, refer the expression to
Chium maris cupers (Sat. ΙΙ. 8. 15),
and suggest as possible explanations
