74 A. PERSII FLACCI

Disce, sed ira cadat naso rugosaque sanna,
Dum veteres avias tibi de pulmone revello.
Non praetoris erat stultis dare tenuia rerum
Officia atque usum rapidae permittere vitae:
Sambucam citius caloni aptaveris alto. Δ 95
Stat contra ratio et secretam garrit in aurern,
Ne liceat facere id quod quis vitiabit agendo.

and Nero and wrote a work in three
books entitled Jus Civile to which
Persius probably refers. An inscrip-
tion discovered in 1 836 seemsto point
to Verona as his birthplace. Jahn
quotes the following passage from
Arrian (diss. IV. 3. 12) in reference
to his work οὗτοί εἰσιν οἱ ἐκεῖθεν
ἀπεσταλμένοι νόμοι, ταῦτα τὰ δια-
τάγματα· τούτων ἐξηγητὴν δεῖ Ὑε-
νέσθαι, τούτοις ὑποτεταγμένον, οὐ τοῖς
Μασουρίου καὶ Κασσίου.

rubrica] because the titles and
first few words of the laws were
commonly picked out with vermi-
lion 3 Cf. Perlege rubras llsajorum
leges (Juv. XIV. 192) and Prudent.
in Symm. ΙΙ. 460 Cur rubrica mine-
tur, Quae prohibet peccare reos,

vetavit] insolens-forma, qnae lagi-
!m' etiam apud Serv. ad Virg. Am.
H. 201 (Jahn), while there is a
doubtful example of velaverant in a
letter of Plane. ad Cic. (Ezm. X. 23).

91—94] ‘Hearken to me, but
let all trace of anger and curling
sneers be banished from your nose
while I root out of your breast these
old wives' sables. No magistrate
has the power to teach fools the
nicer shades of duty, or to impart to
others the true use of sseeting lise.'

91 cadat naso] Cf. Theocr. 1. 18
καὶ οἱ dez δριμεῖα χολαὶ ποτὲ ῥινὶ
κάθηται and Plaut. Amph. IV. 3. 40
Vetas es! adagium ,· simzcs ct mora
bilem iu nasum concidat.

92 veteres avias] sabellos aniles,-
’γραώδεις μύθους. ’γραῶν ὕθλος.

93 erat] ‘snas never lma' the
power) For· the tense cf. Quanta

laborabas Charybdi (al. laboras ι’]ι).

stuitis] is explained by Hor. Sol.
ΙΙ. 3. 43 Quem mala stultitia et quem-
cunque inscitia veri Caecum agl?¹
insanum Chrysippi porticus et grex
A utmnat.

94 usum] like tenuia officia means,
I think with Macleane, the ‘true
use of fleeting lifes But to ‘allow
them the free exercise of life’ is a
legitimate v translation, and appa-
rently authorised by Jahn who adds
qnae sesam ferat et rapiat stallum,
philosophia non firmatum.

95 sambucam] a four-stringed
harp. It was an eastern instrument,
and was no doubt in use long before
the time of Ibycus of Rhegium, to
whom its invention is ascribed by
Athenaeus (IV. ²33 XIV. S).

ca10ni alto] ‘ a gaunt camp portes)
They were used to hew wood and
draw water for the service of the
camp. (Cf. Serv. ad Virg. Aen. Ι.
413 VI. Ι). Afterwards the name
came to be used inore generally'of
other porters cf. Hor. Ep. Ι. 14. 41 3
and Sen. Ep. 110.

96 Stat contra ratio] ‘Common
sense forbids the notion.' Cf. Mart.
Ι. 54. 12 Ssat conlra dicitque tibi tua
pagana: sm- es sor the notion of
‘confronting’ which is contained in
stare contra. Here, and again in
ver. 119, there is the doubt whe-
ther ralia means the ‘reason cys tlze
Sloz'csss se. their philosophy (as in
ver. 39) or rather the ‘common
sense’ claimed by all rnen alike.
The word natam in ver. 98 points
Ι think to the latter as the right
