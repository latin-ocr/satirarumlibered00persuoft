not the reality of the Stoic system which had attraffions
for Seneca. And this difference of charaGter makes
itself perceptible in their respective compositions, for the
style of Seneca is easy and brilliant and superficial, that
of Persius on the other hand is laboured and earnest as
though he felt deeply the importance of the subject on ·
which he wrote.

Jahn attempts to prove that the friendship of our
author for the poet Lucan rested on a similar footing, but
with less satisfactory results as Macleane well points
out. In the case of Seneca all that is known of him
from other sources tends to shew that his was an artificia]
character, one that would certainly not find favour
with an uncompromising Stoie like Persius, in addition
to which we have the express statement of the biographer
that such was really the fact. But with Lucan the case
is different, and ‘although Jahn takes pains to shew that
there could be no great sympathy between the impetuous
Spaniard and the quiet modest Persius, yet very opposite
characters are drawn into intimacy by circumstances
and by particular points of mutual attraffion. Lucan is
said to have praised the poetry of Persius with every
appearance of sincerity, and that would be a virtue in
his or any author's eyes.’

Among the friends of Persius the biographer speaks

es, in very high terms of one Claudius Agathemerus, a phy-

sician of Lacedaemon, and one Petronius Aristocrates, a
native of Magnesia. Of these men little is known, though
Martha (sur les Moralistes Romaines) instances them as
examples of Stoic reformers who would press their doc-
trines in season and out of season. It is supposed that
the former of the two is the subject of the following
epitaph which is still preserved among the Arundel
marbles,
Κλαύδιος ἰητὴρ Ἀγαθήμερος ἐνθάδε κεῖμαι,

Παντοίης δεδαώς κραιπνὸν (ἶκεσμα νόσου·
