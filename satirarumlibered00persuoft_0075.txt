SATIRA III. 47

Murmura quum secum et rabiosa silentia rodunt

Atque exporrecto trutinantur verba labello,

Aegroti veteris meditantes somnia, gzgni

De nihilo nilzil, z'rz nihilum nil posse reverti.

Hoc est, quod palles? cur quis non prandeat, hoc est?---85
His populus ridet, multumque torosa iuventus

Ingeminat tremulos naso crispante cachinnos.—

Inspice,· nescio quid trepidat milei pectus et aegris
Faucibus exsuperat gravis lzalz'tus; inspice, sodes!

ver. 84. nihilum Mp. Herm. 3 nihil B1. Jahn, Mael. Koenig.

capite obstipe), multum similis metu-
enti.

figentes lumine terram] a bold
variation of the ordinary phrase figzt
lumina terra, ox· figunt in ter) am
oculos.

81 rabiosa] Jahn well compares
the following from Paul. Aegin-
(v. 3) on the subjecit of mad dogs
Ἀφωνοι τουπίπαν εἰσί.. ,χωρὶς ὑλα-
*ruofi

silentia] as being a soliloquy ad-
dressed only to themselves. Auson.
Ja'.>w11.24 has imitated the line
thus, Murmure concluso rabiosa si-
lentz'a rodunt.

82 trutinantur] Cf. Varro περὶ
φιλοσοφίας (apud Non. s. v. rostrum),
unumquodque verbum stalera aura-
ria ponderare (Jahn).

85] Cf. Postquam est impransi
correptus voce magisth (Hor. Sat. 11.
5· ¹257)-

86 torosa] the ‘brawny youth of
R01ne‚’ sc. proud of nothing but
their muscular strength.

87 naso crispante] ‘ with curling
nose,' is best explained by rhinoce-
rotis nasum, Mart. 1. 4 (al. 3). 6. Cf.
note on Sat. 1. 40.

88] This line introduces a change
of subje& so abrupt that it should
have been noticed by the commen-
tators. Ι have already noticed that

it is a continuation of νει-165. ‘ Take
moral disease in time and.> it may be
cured by the followingprecepts of
philosophy: rejecst them, as the
world would have you do, and
moral,sickness will end in moral
death.

Inspice] To arrest his .- attention
the poet calls up a pieture of physi-
cal sickness, ‘Look at my tongue:
I have a strange palpitation of the
heart, and my breath is laboured and
fetidff

trepidat] Mr Paley has suggested
to me that heart disease is often at-
tended with the dropsical symptoms
alluded to ver. 95.

89 gravis] Jahn considers that
this word, like exsuperat, denotes
nothing more than a difficulty of
breathing. Cf. Virg. Georg 111. 506
attradlus ab allo spiritus et interdum
gemilu gram& But in a poet who
compresses his ideas so closely as
Persius, it is safer to regard every
word as adding something to the
sense of the passage. For the trans-
lation ‘fetid‚' cf. grave olentia centau-
rea.

sodes] For the resolved form os
this expression cf. Plaut. Aul. 11. 1.
48 Dic milti, si audes, quae ea est,
quam ducere vis uxorem (Schol. ).
