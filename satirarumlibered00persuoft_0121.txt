SATIRA VI.

Egregius lusisse senes.

Mihi nunc Ligus ora

Intepet‚ hibernatque meum mare, qua latus ingens

Dant scopuli et multa litus se valle receptat.

authority of the other MSS. The
combination of the two readings
jocos and senes, which Jahn has ad-
mitted into his text, appears to me
indefensible and almost incapable of
translation, for that senes can be the
adjective to jocos in the sense of
seniles I cannot bring myself to re-
gard as possible. Of the two alter-
natives proposed above Ι have had
little hesitation in adoptingjacis and
senes with Heinrich. We thus ob-
tain a most admirably balanced de-
scription of the two branches of
satire, (1) jocose, (2) serious 3 and
in proof that Bassus was a writer
of satire we may quote the follow-
ing from Jahn: ‘apua' Fulgent. Ex-
βας. Serm. Antz'q. ser). vervina, qni
laudatar Gabius (ita coa'a'. ant.)
Bassus in Satyris, vix dubita quin
noster sit intellegendus) If on the
other hand the reading jocos and
senex is preferred, the sense of the
passage will be something to this
effect: ‘Of rare skill in handling
youthful themes (cf. Ov. T rist. V. 1.
7) and in singing (or perhaps sati-
rz'sing) with a dig-nity beyond your
years (senex).' To judge from his re-
lations with Persius, Bassus was not
an old man at the present time3 con-
sequently senex must not be taken
literally, which is in itself a slight
confirmation of the reading Ι have
preferred.

ing the warmth of the Ligurian coast,
and the sea> Ι love wears its winter
aspect) For ngus ora cf. femina
Ligus (Tae. ffl'st. 1 1. 13), and Phaeax
populus (Juv. XV. 23).

7 Intepet] For the same reason
Horace retires to the sea-coast for
the winter. Cf. Ep. 1. 7. 10, Quod
,η’ bruma nives Albanis illinet affl}

Aa'mare descendet vates tuus, et sibi
parcet, Contrac‘tnsque leget.

hibernat] One of the most diffi-
cult expressions in Persius, as at
first sight the context seems to show
that the'idea of a rough and wintnv
sea would be out of place in the
present passage. Yet such Ι believe
to be the meaning, as a passage in
Cic. N.D. 11. 10 proves that at
such times the temperature of the
sea, and consequently of the climate,
was supposed to be raised: illaria
agitata ventis ita tepescunt nt intellzgri
filcile possit in tantis illis humoribus
inclusum esse calorem: nec enim ille
externus et adventitius habendus est
tepor, sea' ex intimis maris partibus
agitatione excitatns. From the cor-
responding expression of Horace,
defendens pisces hiemat mare, the
translation ‘resting, lying by for the
Winter’ (cf. χειμάζειιι, χειμερίζειν,
‘to go into winter-quarters') has
come into favour, but the interpre-
tation I have suggested will explain
both passages, and how the sea can
be said to be at ‘rest' in the winter is
more thanI can say, though the scho-
liast is ready with an explanation, sicut
enim naves hiemare dicimus quum
nan nawgant sic et mare dum non
navigatur.

meum] like vere sna, ‘the spring-
time they love’ (ofthe bees, in Virg.
Georg. IV. 22), and most certainly
not to be pressed in proof that Luna
was the poet's native-place.

ceant et frangant ; cf. Virg. Aen. Ι.
105 (Jahn). For multa se valle re-
ceptat, &meduna vallis (Hor. Carm.
1. 17. 17). Macleane comments on
this as an accurate description os
