12 A. PERsn ’111Αο01

Os populi meruisse, et cedro digna locutus

Linquere nec scombros metuentia carmina nec tus ?-
Quisquis es, o, modo quern ex adverso dicere feci,

Non ego, quum scribo, si forte quid aptius exit— 45

Quando haec rara avis est—si quid tamen aptius exit,

Laudari metuam, neque enim mihi comea fibra est ς

Sed recti finemque extremumque esse recuso

Euge tuum et belle.

Nam belle hoc excute toturn:

Quid non intus habet? non hic est Ilias Atti 50
Ebria veratro? non si qua elegidia crudi

42 Os populi] not (as Macleane
imagines) the same expression as
that made proverbial by Ennius volilo
vivus per ora virum. In the latter
case ora is the lips of men, in the for-
mer os is the favour expressed by a
kind look.

cedro] For the eustom of rubbing
books with cedar oil to preserve
thern from decay cf. Hor. Α rs Poet.
331 and Vitruvius, who says (11. 9)
Quae unguuntur cedro ut libri a
tineis et carie nan laeduntur.

43 scombros] Cf. Hor. Ep. 11. 1.
269 sqq, Mart. ΙΙΙ. 2. 4 sqq. IV. 87. 8
nec scombris tunicas dabis molestas
(addressed to his book).

44] At this point the poet adopts
a more serious tone in place of the
one which had given offence to his
opponent.

45 non ego] Notice the emphatic
position of non. ‘I am the very
last person to decline praise.’ Cf.
Hor. Ep. Ι. ro. 37 sqq. non ego vento-
sae plebis szff’agia venor, and Sat. Ι.
6. 1.

aptius] ‘any happy expression)
For the modest repetition Macleane
well compares quod spiro et placeo si
placeo tuum est.

exit] may be a metaphor from
pottery ‘turned off’ from the wheel.
Cf. Hor. A. P. 21 Amphora coepit
Institui, currente rota cur urceus
exit. The same word is used of a
book in Martial‚ x. 70.1‚ Quod mihi

vix unus toto liber exeat anno. For
an imitation of this passage cf. Quint.
XII. 10. 26 Audiam dicentem Non
fecit hoc Demosthenes? et si quid
exierit numeris aptius, fhrlasse non
possit, sed tamen si quid exierit aptius,
non erit Atticum ?

47 fibra] Pars pro toto. The liver
was composed of four fibrae (Cels).
‘For verily my heart's not made of
horn’ (or else of wood, for the Latin
may mean either).

48] ‘ But I do deny that y'our
‘ Euge’ ‘ Belle' are the end and aim
of all that is right.’

finis] the τέλος 01· ‘final cause'
of an aetion.

49 excute] ‘sift.’ Cf. Sat. v. νη,
JUV. VI. 143, Si verum excutias, Hor.
Sat. 1. 3. 35. It is the Greek ἐκσείειν
(Aristoph. Aclz. 344), and means
primarily to ‘ shake out the clothes'
of a suspedted thies.

50 Atti] SoJahn,Herm.; al. Acci.
Both names are found but the former
more frequently.

51—55] All rich authors can
command praise. Cf. Hor. Ep. 1.
19. 37. ‘What is the poem it does
not embrace? You will find in it
the Iliad of Attius besotted with
hellebore, the after dinner sonnets
improvised by our great people; in
a word, anything and everything
that is composed on a citron couch.
You know the art of serving up a
delicacy hot and hot, os giving an
