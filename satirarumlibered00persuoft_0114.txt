86 A. PERSII FLACCI

Rixanti populo, nostra* ut Floralia possint
Aprici meminisse senes: quid pulchrius? At quum

Herodis venere dies, unctaque fenestra

Dispositae pinguem nebulam vomuere lucernae

Portantes violas, rubrumque amplexa catinum
Cauda natat thynni, tumet alba fidelia vino:

cleaned toga which a candidate
would wear on his round of visits,
and is explained by Isid. XIV. 24,
Fz't toga addito quodam cretae genere
candz'dzbr.

177—189] ‘ Look alive. she says,
and ply the scrambling rabble well
with peas, that old men as they
bask in the sun may talk of the
Floralia we gave: was ever any-
thing fine) ? Then again when
Herod’s day eomes round, and the
lanterns wreathed with violets and
ranged along the greasy window-
sills have vomited their murky
cloud, when the tail of the tunny
overlapping the red dish floats in
its sauce and the white jar brims
with wine, you move your lips in
silence and grow pale over the
sabbaths of the circumcised. Then
comes the sear of black ghosts, and
the dangers of the broken egg: and
finally the huge Galli and the one-
eyed priestess with her rattle in-
spire you with a dread of the Gods
who blast. the body, if you have fail-
ed to taste the prescribed head of
garlic three times in the morning.'

178 nostra] fle. ‘when you and 1
were aediles,' as the poet identifies
himself ironically with the man in
the text. The Floralia was cele-
brated from the 28th of April till
the ‘znd of May.

179 Aprici] Cf. note on Sat. IV.
18.

quid pulchrius 2⁷] Ι have follow-
ed Herm. and Macl. in conne<ffing
these words with what precedes as
the comment of the old men upon
the splendour of the entertainment.
Others (Jahn included) explain them
as ironical, ‘All very fine, but when
the time eomes you are the slave of
superstition.' There is however no
particular force in the taunt and no
reason, so far as I can see, for sup-
posing that Ambition and Supersti-
tion are exemplified in the same in-
dividual.

are used to denote the different
stages of superstition each a grado
lower than the last, rather thau
‘now one and now the other‚' a
translation which breaks the cohe-
rence of the entire passage.

180 Herodis dies] The birthday
os Herod the Great is meant, ac—
cording to the schol.‚ an explana-
tion which is borne out by Je-
rome who mentions that Herod was
one os the two kings who caused
their birthdays to be observed in
this manner. The allusion how-
ever is not to be pressed, as Persius
