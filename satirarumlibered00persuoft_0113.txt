SATIRA v. 85

Nunc ferus et violens, at si vocet, lzaud mora, dicas.—
Quidnam igitur faciam? ne nunc, quum arcessat et ultro
Supplicet‚ accedam ?—Si totus et integer illinc

Exieris, ne nuno—Hic, hic, quem quaerimus, hic est:

Non in festuca, lictor quarn iactat ineptus.

175

Ius habet ille sui palpo, quem ducit hiantem

Cretata ambitio? vigila et cicer ingere large

ver. 17²· uec nunc Mp. 7. Herm. Macl. ; ne nuuc Bx. Jahn, Koenig.
accessor Mp ; arcersor γ ; accersor Herm. ; arcessat B1. Jahn, Macl.

translation of this passage contra-
dicts itself, ‘Yon would not even
now if you had left her whole and
sound. Here, here is the man we
look for, here, not in the rod which
the silly victor fiourishes 3’ as it sup-
poses the man to have yielded‚ and
thereby stultifies the praise which
follows. Persius clearly had it in
view that Chaerestratus should be
persuaded by the slave’s reasoning
and thus form the first and only
example in the Satire of the true
Stoic liberty, ‘If you escaped from
her with a whole heart then, don‘t
go near her now.'

174 Exieris] With the exception
of the two best, the MSS are mostly
in favour of exieris, a reading which
I have not hesitated to restore, more
especially as the alteration to exi-
eras appears to me to have been
productive of the two following
errors:

(i) The translation of ne nunc as
equivalent to ne nunc quidem, which
Jahn is obliged to bolster up with
the following note: ne uon positum
esse pro ne...quide1n‚ ue opud poetas
quidem, docuit Aladv. ad C lc. defin.
Ι. 11. 39 monuitque hujus usus uos-
trum et Horatii locum lautum stare
testimonia. Verum cum apud Petro-
nium bis ita positum legatur (9. 47)

exieras Mp. 131. Herm. Jahn, Macl. Koenig; exieris γ.

vide an sermoni populari lzoc tribuen-
dum sit indeque translatum ,-

(ii) The introdiustion of the read-
ing nec nuuc, which has been adopt-
ed by those editors who felt them-
selves unable to justisy ue nunc in
the formula above mentioned.

The possible justificatior] of exie-
ras in the following connection,
si exieras...72e nunc (accedas), ‘grant—
ing that you had escaped heart-
whole then, don't go near her now,'
by the analogy of the Gk. εἴ γε,
εἴπερ with the indicative, is rendered
unnecessary by the general agree-
ment of the Mss in favour of exieris,
which restores to the sentence its
simple and natural construction.

174 Hic hic] Cf. Hor. Ep. Ι. 17.
39 Hic est aut nusquam quod quae-

176—179] The slavery of Ambi-

Superstition.
