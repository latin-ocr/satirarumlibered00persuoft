Qui dicit medico, iussus requiescere, postquam 90
Tertia compositas vidit nox currere venas,

De maiore domo, modice sitiente lagena,

Lenia loturo sibi Surrentina rogavit.—

Heus, bone, tu palles! lVilzil est.

Videas tamen istud,

Quidquid id est: surgit tacite tibi lutea pellis. 95
At tu deterius palles ,· ne sis mila· tutor,-

Iam pridem lamec sepeli: tu restas.

Perge, tacebo.

ver. 93. rogabit Herm.; rogabis Mp.; rogavit B1. Jahn, Macl. Koenig.

90 requiescere] to ‘lie by,’ ⁶ keep
himself quiet. ¹

The disease has apparently shown
itself in the acute form of a ⁶ quartan
ague‚' which is rendered fatal by
the patient taking wine on the third
night. He thinks that he may ven-
ture because there has been no par-
oxysm on the third night, whereas
he should have waited for the fozwtlz.

92 de majore domo] ‘from a
large town-house.’ It may mean
(i) from a merchant of established
reputation (de nobili apotheca, Schol.),
or (ii) a divite quodam amasco (Jahn).
A comparison with Mart. 11. 40,
JuV. V. 32 is certainly in favour of
the latter interpretation.

modice sitiente] a ‘tolerably
thirsty ssagon.’ Jahn on the other
hand imagines that a small flask is
meant, and discovers in this and in
the class of wine sele&ed a. semi-
compliance with the doctor's orders.
The ‘ mild‘ Surrentine wine was eer-
tainly recommended sor invalids on
account of its lightness (ef. Plin.
xx111. 1. το, xiv. 6. Sl, but the
tenor of the lines which follow,
inore especially the addition of the
word loturo, are almost decisivo
against Jahn's theory, as ‘before the
hath' would be the most fatal time
sor taking thc wine. Cf. Juv. r. 142
Poena tamen praesens quum tu de-
ponis umidus Turgidus, et crudum
pavonem in balnea ortas.

94 Heus, ‘bone The words of

the doetor at their next meeting,
‘ My good sir, how pale you are‘! '

96] ‘Nay, you are paler than 1:
never think to school me: I have
already buried one of you: you are
still on my hands. Wdl' choose your
own course: J wan't sagit a atomi! '

ne sis mihi tutor] Cf. Hor.
Sat. ΙΙ. 3. 88 „Ne sis patruus milri.
The expression which follows is pro-
verbial, and Jahn well compares
Isid. Orzgr. X. 5, litt. T. Tutor, qm*
pupillum tuetur, ltoc est, intuetur, dc
quo in consuetudine vulgari dicitur:
Quid me mones ? et tutorem et paeda-
gogum olim obrui.

97 tu restas] so Omms composui.
E’lz'ces l nunc ego rcslo. (Hor. Sat. ι.

. 28.)
9 98 'turgidus epuns] as in Hor.
Ep. Ι. 6. 61 Crudi tumidique lava-
mur. Cf. also Juv. 1. 142 sqq„ the
passage referred to above on ver. 93.

albo ventre] Cf. Hor. Sat. 11. 2.
76. Paleness was naturally regarded
us a sign of delicate licalth in a
southern climate, where the test os
a rnan’s physic-al strength is his
power os enduring· the ‘licat ofthe
day.' Such words as apm'calt'o, inso-
latio denote the pains which were
taken to avoid the imputation of
‘ paleness.'

99 mefites] is specially used of
the fetid vapour given off from sul-
phur springs (Serv.). With the use
of the word in the present passage
