SATIRA VI. 99

Haec cinere ulterior metuas? At tu, meus heres,
Quisquis eris, paulum a turba seductior audi:
Ο bone, num ignoras? missa est a Caesare laurus

mixture of salt, which was added
to certain Greek wines to give them
a tone), or (ii) ‘of home growth’
‘that has never crossed the seas ’—
the former of which interpretations
is sarfetched, the latter a contradic-
tion of the rest oi the sentence. For
myself⁷ as 1 have stated at length in
the Introd. to the Satires, Ι believe
that Persius often imitated the lan-
guage‚ as distinct from the meaning,
of Horace, and that we are conse-
quently by no means bound to force
on the adopted passage the sense
which is necessitated in the original.

40 vitiarunt] like vitiato in Sat.
11. 64, ‘have mixed and spoilt,’ where
it is used to express a precisely simi-
lar judgment on the part of a man
of the old school.

pultes] like the polenta was the
food of labouring men (cf. Juv.
XIV. 171 Grandes fumabant pultibus
ollae), while unguen is nothing rnore
than the scented oil or sauces which
seem to have been the proverbial
type of luxury. Cf. u7zgepuer cault s
in ver. 69.

41. At this point Peisius plo-
ceeds to meet the two objections in
turn. The first he dismisses with a
brief sneer, as a plea which is not
heart-selt and only raised for want
of something better, ‘Do you really

mean to say that you are afraid of

neglect beyond the grave? (Cf. Hor.
Ep. ΙΙ. 2. 191 Nec metuam quid de
me judicet heres, Quod uon plum
datis invenerit). But with you, my
heir, whoever you are to be, Ι must
have a serious word or two, so come
apart from the throng and listen to
me.'

41 cinere ulterior] Gk. περαιτέρω
κόνεως.

4² Quisquis eris] The addition
of these words well denotes the
carelessness of the speaker upon the

point in question, while, as a matter
of fact, if a man had no children
the question who was his lzeres legl-
timus might very possibly remain
undecided till his death.

43—50] We now come to a pas-
sage which stands alone in Persius
on account of the personality of its ⁷
satire. The allusions to Nero in
the Ist and 4th Satires had been
carefully veiled, no doubt because he
was still living: but in this instance
the irony is directly and unmistake-
ably aimed at a triumph celebrated
by Caligula after a mock campaign
against the Germans in Β. C. 40,
which is alluded to by Tacitus
(ffi'st. IV. 15) as the Gaianarum
expeditionum ludibrium. The expe-
ditionis thus deselibed in the Ger-
mania, c. 37: Drusus ac Aera et
δι’) mamcus in suls eos (sc. Gemm-
πω) scdzbus βενεῑιῖενιιλί. Post mgen-
tes C. Caesaris minae 2⁷72 ludibrium
versae. Inde otium, donec ocsctsione
dz'scoaffiae nostrae et civilium armo-
rum, expugnatis legionum hibernis,
eliam Gallias affi‘c‘lavere‚ ac rursus
pulsi iude proxinu's temporibus trium-
phau 772ag72r quam vim sunt.

43 Ο bone, num ignoras] like
Hbus, hene, tu palles (Sat. ΙΙΙ. 94);
‘My good sir, haven't you heard
the news? A despatch has arrived
from the emperor reporting the
signal defeat of the flower of the
German army, so the cold ashes are
being sw ept from the altars and the
empress is even now engaged in
hiring arms for the doorposts, royal
cloaks and yellow beaids for the
captives, war-chariots and tall Rhe-
nish men. So in honour of the
Gods and the good fortune of our
general I intend to bring out a hun-
dred pairs of gladiators to celebrate
the glorious victory: who forbids?
Just venture to do so. Vt'oe betide
