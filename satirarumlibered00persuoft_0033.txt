Quod si dolosi spes refulserit nummi,

Corvos poetas et poetridas picas

Cantare credas Pegaseium nectar.

ver. 12. refulgeat Mp. Herm.; reficlserit B1. Jahn, Macl. Koenig.

1 have already suggested in the
argument the only interpretation
which appears to me to suit at once
the context, the repetition of the
word picas and the contrast im-
plied in quod si.
starvation may teach pies to talk,
but the hope of making a fortune
can do more, for it can teach the
pies of the poet-world-rnyself‚ for
instance—to produce very creditable
poetry.'

dolosi] A generic epithet3 the
Greek δόλιον κέρδος (Pind. Pyth. 1v.
140. Diss.). But Jahn, quia ejus
splendor poetas facit qui facultate
poetica destituti sunt.

‘A process of

13 poetridas] The feminine form
in consideration of the gender of
picas, and not (as Jahn suggests) by
way of a covert attack upon the

female poets of the day.
14 cantare...nectar] Cf. manare

poetica mella, Horace, Ep. 1. 19.

44. Most of the MSS, with the ex·
ception however of the two best,
read melos for nefflar in defiance
of the metre. Macleane well sug-
gests the probability of melos being
a gloss, the original of which
was mel.

Pegaseium] Sc. the poetry of in-
spiration. Cf. ver. 1.
