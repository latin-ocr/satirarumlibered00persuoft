A. PERSII FLACCI

Ad populum phaleras! ego te' intus et in cute novi. 30
Non pudet ad rnorem discincti vivere Nattae?

Sed stupet hic vitio, et fibris increvit opimum

Pingue: caret culpa, nescit quid perdat, et alto

Demersus summa rursum non bullit in unda.

Magne pater divum, saevos punire tyrannos 3 5
Haud alia ratione velis, quum dira libido

Moverit ingenium ferventi tincta veneno:

ver. 37.

that hardly any necessity could jus-
tisy it.

Censoremve tuum is Jahn’s read-
ing and unquestionably the correc‘t
one, though he hardly does himself
or the„ poet justice when he adds
the following explanation, Permife
vero repetita est particula quod mm
nisi ex z'llaudabz'li quadam neglzgenlicz
explicari potest, quare haud mirum si
simile exemplum non potest affiwv',·
nam quod affiv‘lnr Tibulli (IV. 1. 91)
Aut quis equum celeremve aresti)
compescere freno possit in eo variam!
liba-i nec critici consentiunt. He sails
to notice that censorem tuum and tm-
beate eonvey two separate ideas, and
that ve and vel are both required to
couple them, ‘because you have a
censor in your family, or are your-
self a knight of distinffion’ (sc.
quodve censorem tunm salutas, vel
quod ilfise trabeatus es). With the vo-
cative trabeate cf. Audaci quicum-
qzaeqfflate Cratino, I. 123. Also Juv.
VI. 277, Hor. Sat. ΙΙ. 6. 20, Tib. I.
7- 53·

trabeate] ‘os equestrium ranl<‚’
as the trabea was worn by the egrrgrii
equites in the lmznsveffll'o. (Cf. Liv.
ix. 46.) lt might also mean ‘of
consular fainily,⁷ as the trabea was
likewise the dress of the consuls,
but the word phaleras in the next
line is almost conclusive in favour
os the former interpretation.

,ξω-34] ιΤο the pcople with
your trappings! I know you inside

and out. Are you not ashamed to
be living like dissolute Natta? N ay:
lzz's conscience is deadened by vice:
the gross fat has grown over his
heart: blame him you cannot for
he ,knows not what he loses, and
having once sunk in deep water
never rises again to the sursace of
the wave.‘

30 Ad populum phaleras] For
phaleras cf. το) τοῦ πλούτου φάλαρα
(Plut. de Cup. Dl'v. 10). The phalerae
included all the trappings of the
horse and rider. They were on oc-
casion much ornamented with metal‚
and Polybius (VI. 2. 3) says they were
given as rewards of merit to cavalry
soldiers. He means ‘smart eques as
you are, you can only impose cn
the vulgar!

intus] So in ver. 42, and again in
Sat. v. 129. For iu cute cf. Seu.
Ep. 50 Psffcst insaniunt potissimum at·
beatissimam snb qualibet cute latere.

31 discincti] See note on IV. 22.
Nalm is a name taken at random
from Horace (Sat. Ι. 6. 124), where
it does duty for a miser. This in-
discriminate use of proper name>
goes sar to prove the very general
enm-adio:- of l'crsius’ satire.

32 stupet hic vitio] like saepe
malis stupco, Ovid. Her. VIII. 110.
It means more than ‘sins in igno-
rance,' as it is commonly truns-
latcd. The argument is ‘ Nay, Ι do
Natta an injustice by the compari-
son, sor his conscience is numbed by
