SATIRA Ι. 19

Hoc natat in labris, et in udo est Maenas et Attis,

Nec pluteum caedit, nec demorsos sapit ungues.—
Sed quid opus teneras mordaci radere vero

Auriculas? vide sis, ne maiorum tibi forte

Limina frigescant3 sonat hic de nare canina

Nil moror. Euge omnes! omnes bene mirae eritis reS.
Hoc iuvat? Hic, inquis, veto quisquam faxit oletum!

tween Persius and his friend similar
to that by which it had been intro-
duced. ‘C. All true enough, per-
haps, but why proclaim it? Take
care prithee that the rich do not
show you the cold shoulder. There’s

a sound in the air of the snarling·

dog’s letter. P. Indeed! Then, for
all I care, let everything henceforth
be beautiful. It makes no matter
to me. Well done Σ all of you, you
shall all be wonderful creatures!
Are you satisfied now? ‘ No nui-
sance here‚’ do you say? Then
paint up the two snakes, and, boys,
be off?

107 Mordaci vero] Cf. opimum
pingue (111. 32), generosum honestum
(11· 74)-

109 frigescant] Cf. majorum ue
quis amicus Frigore le feriat (Hor.
Sat. 11. ι. 60).

camna littera] the Greek P as
resembling in sound the snarl of a
dog. So Shaksp. Rom. and Jul. 11. 4
‘R is for the dog.’ He alludes to the
notice cave canem painted up at the
great man's door. If no dog was
kept on the premises‚ there would
probably be the picture of one in
fresco or mosaic close beside the
notice. Cs. Petron. 29.

110 equidem] if compounded of
ego quidem must originally have
been confined to verbs in the xst
person. It is used otherwise, once

in Terence (Eun. V. 4. 34), in Pro-
pertius (111. 29. 5), and again in
Persius (V. 45). But probably, as
Heinrich says, it is no inore than
quidem; cf. κεῖνος, ἐκεῖνος. Donald-
son’s explanation (Vari-on. p. 443)
is beset with difficulties.

111 omnes bene] etenim bene is
the reading of most MSS, which is
however so weak that most of the
best editors have rejected it.

113 Pinge duos angues] A sign
of dedication rather than prohibition.
Jahn well quotes an inscription ac-
companied by two snakes, Duodecim
Deos et Dianam et Jovem opt. max.
habeat iratos quisquis liic minxerit
aut cacarit. Mr Paley, however,
has furnished me with an instance
in which the same device is beyond
all question permissory, as it is
painted above a testa devoted to
this very use, and he would translate
it so here, referring it to a spot just
outside the ‘ charmed circle.' But,
with Jahn’s quotation on the other
side, I should prefer to explain it
more generally by the serpent wor-
ship of Greece and Rome, in which
particular spots were devoted to par·
ticular purposes, and placed under
the protection of a particular Genius
or Daemon. Here the protec‘ting
power will be the ‘Genius of poetry.'
