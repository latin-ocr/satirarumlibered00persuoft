SATIRA ΙΙ.

THIS Satire is addressed to Plotius Macrinus, who had been the fellow
pupil of Persius in the house of Servilius. The subje& and character of
the composition are well expressed by Jahn in the following remarks: Quod
in scholis philosophorum saepissime disputabatur argumentum de precibus
id hac Satira ita tradat Persius ut luculentis quibusdam exemplis hominum
vulgares errores perstringat. It opens with congratulations to Macrinus on
the occasion of his birthday (1—4), the mention of which leads Persius to
contrast the honest prayers of his friend with those offered by the gene-
rality of mankind, which he then proceeds to satirize on the following
grounds:

(1) Their worldliness (7—16). Men pray for the death of a rich uncle:
the discovery of a treasure: the death of an obstrucffive ward, or of a tire-
some wife.

(2) Their z'mpz'ety (17—30)3 for men are not ashamed to offer up prayers
to Jupiter which would shock the lowest of mankind.

(3) Their extravagance (31—40), exemplified by the prayers of a nurse
for the future prosperity of her charge.

(4) Their inconsistency witlz tlte conduc? of the worshipper (41—5 1) who
prays for health while he is ruining his constitution, or for riches while he
is wasting his property in sacrifice.

(5) Their demoralising effeci* upon tlte externals of religion (52—end);
for men estimate the wishes of the gods by their own earthly standard of
desire, in evidence of which he adduces the lavish use of gold in religious
ceremonies.

For the occasion of the Satire cs. Juv. Sat. XII.

For the subjec‘t cf. Plato, Alc. 1 1, Juv. Sat. x. The tone which pervades
it is such as would be adopted by a Stoic resormer.
