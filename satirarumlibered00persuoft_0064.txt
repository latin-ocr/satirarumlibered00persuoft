36 A. PERSII FLACCI

Sufficiat, quinta dum linea tan'gitur umbra.

En quid agzlr? siccas insana canicula· messes 5

Iam dudum coquit et patula pecus omne sub ulmo esf,

Unus ait comitum.——Verumne? itane? ocius adsit

Huc aliquis! nemon'P—Turgescit vitrea bilis:

Findor—ut Arcadiae pecuaria rudere dicas.

Iam liber et positis bicolor membrana capillis 10

uses this very word indomitum.
Others translate ‘undigested,’ but
the more general interpretation is
preferable.

despumare] is the word used sor
skimming off the froth from boiling
must (Virg. Georg. 1. 296). It is
used by Seneca as a neuter verb in
reference to anger (De Ira, ΙΙ. 20)
like ἀποστάζειν in Soph. Antzgr. 959
οὕτω τᾶς μανίας δεινὸν ἀποστάζει ἀν-
θηρόν τε μένος, ‘drips away‚‘ sc. to
nothing.

4 quinta] made to agree with
umbra instead of linea by hypallage.
The hour signified would be about
1 1 o'elock‚ as at the summer solstice
the 6th hour would nearly correspond
to our noon. On the subject of the
solaria, which were introduced into
Rome according to Pliny (νυ. 60)
B.c. 294, cf. Becker, Gall. Ι. p. 186
s .
q5 En quid agis ¹7] is more sorciblc
as the first words of the comes than
as the last of the Philosopher. I
have consequently departed here
srom Hermann’s arrangement.

7 comitum] ‘Says one os his
sellow students.' These words are
referred by others to one of the
Professor's attendants, and by Jahn
to the Professor himself. But the
poet would hardly introduce the ex-
ponent of the Stoic philosophy by
such a casual mention as unus co-
milam.

Verumne 9] ”Αληθες; ‘Do you
mean it? Is it possible? Lct some
one come to me at once 2 Is no one
coming?

8 vitrea] Like splendida in
Horace. Cf. λευκαῖς πιθήσαντα φρα-
σίν, Pind. Pyth. IV. 1093 ὑαλώδης
χολὴ, a colbre splendescente (Jahn).

9 findor—ut] Al. finditur, ‘he
explodes.'

But the reading of the text is
supported by all the best MSS, by
the authority of Servius (ad Virg.
Georg. ΙΙΙ. 328, 374), of the Schol.
(ad Stat. Theb. IV. 44), of Eutych.
(de disc. conj. 11. p. 2173), and is
received by Jahn and Herm„ the
former of whom adds zgro non ausus
sum lec‘lianem deserere tot tantisque
altc'Zorz'busfirmatam. ι

rudere] The quantity of the first
syllable is shortened in Virg. Gcm‘gz
111. 374, Aen. vlt. 16, Ov. Fast.
vr. 342· For pecuaria cf. Juv. VII.
160, Plaut. Asin. ΙΙ. 3. 67.

ιο liber] is the author out of
which the lesson or thesis is to he
transcribed; chartae are the sheets
of papyrus on which he is going to
write ; membrana is the parchment
wrappcr sor preserving the loose
sheets as his work progresses; no-
dosa arundo is his reed-pen.

bicolor] may be taken literally, as
the two sides os the membrana were
osten staincd in different colourx,
purple and ycllow being apparently
the ones most in favour. Cf. caan-mc
membrana tabellae (Juv. Vll. 23);
Lalca sed niveum involvas mrmluwua
libellum (Tib. ΙΙΙ. 1. 9); Abraham
murice cultus (Mm‘t. vill. 72. ι), and
a passage which Jahn quotes from
Lucian de Merc. Cond. ὅμοιοί εἰσι
τοῖς καλλίστοις τούτοις βιβλίοις ὦν
