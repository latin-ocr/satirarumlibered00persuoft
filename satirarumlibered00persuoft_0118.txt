90 A. PERsH FLACC'I

The former of these may be dismissed with a very summary notice.
The sole evidence in favour of Luna as the birthplace of Persius is con-
tained in the line in question, which is after all nothing more than a
favourable mention of the town as a sea-side residence, while his connection
with the place is admirably accounted for by a statement of the scholiast
to the effectthat his mother settled there after her second marriage. On
the other hand, the testimony which points to Volaterrae in Etruria as his
native town is complete and circumstantial. ‘ Natus in Etruria Volaterris'
is the explicit statement of his biographer, for the truth of which we have
strong presumptive evidence in the discovery at Volaterrae of two inscrip-
tions bearing his family name, in the marriage of his kinswoman Arria to
Caecina of Volaterrae, in the name of his mother Sisennia (which is, as
Jahn says, ‘ aperte Etruscum ')‚ and finally in the unstudied allusions to Etru-
ria which occur continually throughout the Satires, as sor instance in the
mention of Arretium (Sat. Ι. 129), of a Tuscan pedigree (Sat. ΙΙΙ. 29),
and of Marsian and Umbrian clients (Sat. 111. 74).

The second question, that of the completeness or incompleteness of the
Satires, will be found discussed in the lntroduetion to the author. Ι need
only reiterate my belief that the sixth Satire is no more than a fragment,
and, in consequence of this, one of the most difficult as well as the least
effective of the series. On the other hand Jahn and Casaubon (and, as I
have since found, Mr Paley) regard it as complete in its present form3 but,
viewed by the light of the biographer's remark, the abruptness of the transi-
tions, the want of connection between vv. 74 and 75, and the brevity with
which the details are sketched rather than filled in, appear to me, as to
Macleane, conclusive evidences of incompleteness. At the same time Ι
am persuaded that the last six lines of the Satire are not the commence-
ment (as he supposes) but the climax of a subject3 sor, whatever may
be its connetftion with the previous verses, the passage in question reads
admirably as a conclzcdl'ng paragraph, and the marks of incompleteness are
surely misplaced after a line which, in sense and sound alike, forms such an
admirable smish to the Satire as ‘ Inventus, Chrysippe, tui finitor acervi.'

The subject of the Satire is well expresscd in the following notice by
Jahn, ‘In hac Satira stultitiam eorum notaturus est qui rei familiari au-
gendae intenti omnia gaudia sibi denegant, neque tamen unquam sibi satis-
saciunt,’ and may be divided under the following heads :

1—6. A complimentary address to Bassus, whom he supposes to have
retired sor the winter to his Sabine estate.

7—17. Persius himself writes from the sea-const near Luna, where he
passes his time contentedly‚ undisturbed by care or cnvy.

18—24. Another person may prefer greater luxury : sor himself. ne ezr-r
see the distinction between the use and the abesse of wealth.

25—33. A man should live up to his means, and at the same time
recognize the claims of charity, even to the extent it may be of acrificmg a
part of his estate.

34—-37- An objection to this doc‘lrinc os charity is raised by some
