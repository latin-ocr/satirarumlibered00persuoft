SATIRA VI.

Sum tibi Mercurius ; venio deus huc ego ut ille
Pingitur, an renuis? vin' tu gaudere relictis?

Deest aliquid summae.
Quidquid id est.

Ubi sit, fuge quaerere, quod mihi quon-

spent it on myself 3 but what is left
is all yours. Don’t you be asking
what is become of the legacy Tadius
once left me, nor throw in my teeth
my fatherly advice to let the interest
acerne on the capital and to draw
your expenditure from the former.’
61] Notwithstanding the difficul-
ties which beset the question of the
Lampadephoria we may easily ga-
ther from Aeschylus, Lucretius, and
other authors all that is required to
explain the allusions in the present
passage. From these it is clear that
the course was marked out in sta-
tions at each of which a new set of
runners stood ready to take up the
race, and that so long as the torch
remained alight and the conditions
of the race were thus fulfilled it
could not exchange hands except at
these particular stations. The man
in advance would naturally try to
snatch the torch from the previous
holder as soon as he carne up, more
particularly if it was nearly out.
Jahn thus describes the two varieties
of the torch-race: alterum quo unus
quirque cursorum facem suam gesta-
bat, et is villariam reportabat, qui
primus cum face ardente ad metas
perventebat (Paus. Ι. 30. 23 schol.
Aristoph. Rau. 131) ; altero certa-
minis genere eo res rediit ut alter
alteri facem ardentem traderet. Cf.
Plat. Rep. Ι. 328 A λαμπάδια ἔχοντες
διαδώσουσιν ἀλλήλοις ἁμιλλώμενοι
τοῖς ἵπποις. Praecipue vero llaec
imago adhibetur ad vitae necisque

suum vitae locum concedit aut lam-
poda tradit; in quo praeivit Plato
(legg. VI. 776 B): γεννῶντας τε καὶ
ἐκτρέφοντας παῖδας καθάπερ λαμπάδα
τὸν βίον παραδίδοντας ἄλλοις ἐξ
ἄλλων. Cf. Luer. 11. 77 Et quasi

tion between which Jahn writes,
Exspec‘tes vis, cum vin' in simplici

gaudere] Gk. ἀγαπᾶν.

64 Minui mini] Macleane's trans-
lation ‘I have curtailed it to my
own loss' loses all the force of the
passage.

65 fuge quaerere] as in Hor.
Carm. 1. 9. 13, 11. 4. 22.

66 Tadius] Stadius Jahn, although
it is supported, he admits, by only
one inscription, in which moreover
the reading of the name is doubtful.

repone] is not to ‘repeat,' as
Macleane translates it, but to ‘give
back,' ‘retaliate,’ as in Juv. 1. 1.
What is the allusion contained in
dz‘lla paterna it is, Ι think, impos-
sible to say. Taken by themselves
the words might mean generally ‘the
fatherly maxim: use your interert,
and keep your princspal for your lzeir‚’
