50 A. PERs'Ii ’ FLACCI

Hesterni capite induto subiere Quirites.
Dznge, miser, venas et pone' in> pec‘tore dextram .-

Nil calet ln‘c.
Αἴθη flagrent.

Smnmosque pedes attinge manusque:
Visa est si forte pecunia, sive
Candida vieini subrisit molle puella,

110

Cor tibi rite salit? positum est algente catino
Durum olus, et populi cribro decussa farina:

’ amicae obsidet: lzic portas frangit,
at illefhres. (Macl.)

106 capite induto] sc. putting on
the pileus in token they had just
been manumitted by the injunction
of their late master’s will. The
pileus was a skull-cap originally
adopted to hide the baldness of the
new freed-man, for, as in the case of
our conviets, the hair of slaves was
closely shaved. Compare with this
the introducstion of splenia to hide
the three letters on the forehead os
a branded slave.

107] Now follows the picture of
moral sickness: ‘feel my pulse, you
troublesome fellow‚ and lay your
hand upon my chest: you find no
sever here! and touch the extremi-
ties of my hand and feet: no cohl-
ness there !’

miser] like ὦ μέλε, ὦ σχέτλιε, is
an expression os impatienee with
the man who has called up such un-
comsortable thoughts. In the comic
poets the same idea is often express-
ed by malum. It is difficult to un-
derstand how Jahn and Hermann
would translate the passage which
follows, as they assign the words
nil calet lzic and non smgrent to a
different speaker.

111 rite] sc. without acceleration.
Contr. laetari praetrepidum cor.

111—114] ‘Suppose we set be-
fore you a cold dish of hard cabbage,
and meal that has been passed
through the people's sieve. Now
let us try your jaws. Ah l a fester-
ing uleer lurks somewhere in your
tender mouth which must not be
grated with such plebeian sare.’
