Illis remitto, quorum imagines lambunt

Hederae sequaces: ipse semipaganus
Ad sacra vatum carmen affero nostrum.
Quis expedivit psittaco suum χαῖρε,
Picasque docuit verba nostra conari?

the essential characteristic of poets
and other men of study. Cf. 1. 26
En pallor seniumque and Hor. Ep.
1. 19. 17 Quod si pallerem casu,
biberent exsangue cuminum. Pirene
was the spring near Corinth at
which Bellerophon caught and har·
nessed Pegasus.

5 nus] sc. the standard poets of
antiquity, casts of whom had been
collected by Augustus and placed in
his new library on the Palatine. Cf.
Sat. 11. 56 (note), Ovid. Trist. 111.
1. 71.

imagines] Cf. Ovid. Trz'st. 1. 7. 1,
Juv. Sat. νυ. 29 Ut dignus venias
hederis el imagine macra.

6 sequaces] ‘pliant‚’ ‘curling,’ is
the literal meaning. Cf. flammas se-
quaces Virg. Aen. VIII. 432, fumos
sequaces Georg. IV. 230, and Aen. VI.
146 Carpe manu3 namque ipse vo-
lens facilisque sequetur.

semipaganus] ‘half a clown‘
sc. half educated, but cf. Introduc·
tion. Casaubon would translate
‘only half a soldier in the lists os
poetry,' (Cf. Plin. Ep. V11. 25),
while Jahn refers it to the pagani or
members of the pagus, all of whom
sharedin the same sacred rites. But
the remark of the Schol. Paganz'
dicuntur rustici qui non noverunt
urbem suggests a simplet and more
probable interpretation.

7 vatum] ‘poet priests) A
distinction is possibly intended be-
tween the vates and the humbler
poeta.

carmen] Either the Satires as a ·

whole or the first in particular. Cf.

Introduction.

8 ‘ Who taught the parrot to ar-
ticulate its ¹ Bon jour: and magpies
to attempt our human speech ‘2’

suum χαῖρε] We may gather
from the letters of Cicero and Pliny
that it was a common custom in
Rome to enliven conversation by the
introduction of familiar Greek id-
ioms, and Jahn's criticism is again
overstrained when he proposes to
render suum χαῖρε by ‘its native
greeting’ because the parrot was
a forezgrn bird, as opposed to the
verba nostra or ‘good Latin’ of the
indigenous magpie ἔ

9 conarl] A few MSS here in-
troduce corvos quis olim concavum
salutare? a line which sufficiently
condemns itself.

11 venter] ‘ Hunger, so elever
in imitating utterances which nature
has denied.’ Cf. ‘A πενία, Δίοφαντε,
μόνα τὰς τέχνας ἐγείρει, Theocr.
XXI. 1.

artifex sequi] For this common
Greek construction, cf. Sal. 1. 59,
and again, 1. 70.

12 Quod si] Mr Paley would re-
fer these lines to the flatterers de-
nounccd in the Ist Satine, who, sor
pay, would persuade themselves that
a crow was a poet, and praise ac-
cordingly.

Macleane, on the other hand,
would translate, ‘ only pay them sor
their trouble, and these miserable
poets will spout away as if their
stuff was Muses* nectar!
