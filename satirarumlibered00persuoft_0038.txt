10 A PERSII xF'LACCI

Tun', vetule, auriculis alienis colligis escas?
Auriculis‚ quibus et dicas cute perditus ohe !—·

Quo didicisse, nisi hoc fermentum et quae semel intus

Innata est, rupto iecore, exierit caprificus ?— 25

En pallor seniumque! O mores! usque adeone

Scire tuum nihil est, nisi te scire hoc sciat alter ?—. ⁷

At pulchrum est digito monstrari et dicier laic est! · .

Ten’ cirratorum centum dictata fuisse

Pro nihilo pendas ?-—Ecce inter pocula quaerunt ¹ 30

’ Romulidae saturi, quid dia poemata narrent.

most os the MSS and editions have
ubi.

Trans. ‘while their marrow is
tickled by the quavering lines.’

22] ‘What you, old sinner, pan-
(ler thus to the ears of 0111015, ears
to which even you, lost to shame as
you are, would cry out ‘enough’ ‘2'

vetule] like senium, (ver. 26). The
age of the offender aggravates the
offence.

23 dicas] Emphatic like dicam
(ver. 56) nothwithstanding the 011115-
sion of the personal pronoun in both
cases.

cute perditus] like fronte perdt-
tus, of a brow from which all mod-
esty has been lost, ‘unblushing in
vice.’ Cf. Sal. V. 104, exclamet Meli-
(erla perisse Frontem de rebus. The
interpretation ⁶ puffed up by flattery’
15 far less suitable to the context,
even supposing that cute perditus
could mean ⁴ dropsical⁷ which Ι
(10 1101 believe, in spite of Jahn and
Macleane.

ohe!] Cf. Hor. Sal. ΙΙ. 5. 96;
Mart. 111. 9¹· 1 Olze jam salis cst,
ohe libelle J

24] This is the answer of the
iinaginary poet. ‘What is the use
of learning is this leaven and all that
15 born in a man is not to burst from
his 111101· like a wild figtree (from the
tomb)?' For this use of Quo, cf.
Tuv. V111. 9, xv. 61 ; for the

metaphor of the figtree, cf. Juv.
X. 145, sterilis mala robora fisus
(Macl.)

’ 26 En pauor] ‘Shame, I answer,
on your paleness and your hoary
hairs‚' (Cf. note to Prol. 4, and on
vetule ver. 22). Heinrich gives these
words to the preceding speaker, but,
read thus as an apology, they are
weak in the extreme.

28 dig-ito monstrari] δακτυλό-
δεικτος εἶναι (AEsch. Agant. 1332).
(js. Hor. Carm. IV. 3. 22.

dicier] ‘to hear people say of
you, that’s the man.’ (οὗτος ἐκεῖνος).
For this old form of the infinitive,
cf. fallier ΙΙΙ. 50.

29 Tene] We should translate by
the emphatic nominative, ‘would
you, Persius, hold it for nothing?'

cirratorum] Cf. Mart. 9. 30.. 7
cirrata caterva nuzffl'slrz'. Youths
of quality are meant, cs. the Gk.
κομαν.

dictata fuisse] ‘That you have
been adopted as the 1055011 110011,7
because the repetition 10550115 were
first (licffated to the pupils by the
master. Cf. Mart. VIII. 3. 15.
l’roelqgrat ut tumidus rauca te voce
712aKgrzssvri*1*‚ and Juv. VII. 226.

30 Ecce] denotes an abrupt trans-
ition, ‘Come 500 with mc (says the
poet) the true value of the praise
you covet.’

31 Romulidae] Ironical like Τι’-
