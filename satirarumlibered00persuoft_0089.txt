SATIRA V. 61

In style no less than in matter Ι should regard the fifth as facile prin-
ceps amongst the Satires of Persius, for without showing the slightest
signs of diffuseness or want of finish it is to all appearance less laboured
than either the first or the third, and has in it something os the freedom of
Juvenal while it appears to me to possess more ‘body’ (if I may be allowed
the expression) than the majority of his Satires. ·

The argument may be stated as follows ε

1-—4‚ ⁴ O that 1 had a hundred tongues 1’ says Persius.

5—18, Why so? (asks Cornutus) : they are not needed by the Satirist.

19— 51, True enough: but I require them to enable me to sing your
praises worthily‚ that Ι may leave a sitting record of niy gratitude to you
(zi—29), of your kindness to me (3o—4o)‚ and of our mutual friendship
(41—51)·

52—62, Mens’ lives are varied, but most men feel when life is ending
that they lack something.

63—72, You supply that want by bidding them seek philosophy be-
times 3

73—90‚ which alone can give a liberty sar surpassing that of the slave
set free by the magistrate, or of the sels-styled ⁴ independent’ man 3

91—104, sor no magistrate ean impart to you a knowledge of the real
duties of life, and no man may do just what he pleases but only that for
which nature has fitted him.

105—114, If philosophy has taught you to distinguish between virtue
and vice, and to free your soul from the dominion of the passions, you are
really and truly free 3

115—123‚ but, if you are not entirely iu the right, you must be alto-
gether in the wrong.

124—131, You are thinking only of bodily slaveryg and sorget that you
may be the slave of your passions :

132—141‚ as of Avarice3

142—153„ of Luxury3

154—160, from one or other of which you are seldom altogether free3

161—174, of Love3

175—179‚ os Ambiti0n;

rso—188, of Superstition.

189—end‚ Tell all this to a captain in the army, and he‘ll luugh at us
sor our pains.

Vatibus hic mos est, centum sibi poscere voces,

1—18] This introducstion should tained by Cornutus. The careful
be compared with vv. 1—12 of the supervision he exercised over the
first Satire which opens with a simi· studies of Persius is proved by the
lar dialogue, in which the second fact already notieed that he revised
character is in all probability main· the satires for publication, and re-
