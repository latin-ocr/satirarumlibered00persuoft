tains, and the valleys run down to
the shore as Persius describes, and
two or three other bays indent the
coast os the gulf. The name of the
town at which Persius was staying
was not Luna (Luni), which, though
it gave its name to the bay, was
separated from it by a range of hilis
and the river Macra.’

9 est operae] sc. pretium, is the
reading of all the best MSS and
editions: ‘llffake acquaintance witlz
tlze lzarbour cffLuna: ists well wortlz
your while! This is the rational ad—
vice of Ennius when he had snored
off the dream that he was Homer
(and found himself) plain Quintus
once again instead of a Pythagorean
peacock.' The line quoted in the
above passage occurs 111 the Annals
of Ennius. For the allusion to the
dream of Ennius cf. note on Prol.

ver. 1.

10 Cor Enni] sc. Cordum-Ennius.
Cf. Hor. Sat. Ι. 7. 2 Virtus Scipiadae
et mitis sapientia Laeli. This is better
than the ordinary translation ‘ Such
is the heartfelt advice of Ennius,’ as
11 suggests the recovery of his senses
which he had temporarily lost in 1115
dreams of transmigration.

11 Quintus] Heimaginedhimself
to have passed through four succes-
sive changes, the order of which is
given by the scholiast as (i) Pytha-
goras, (ii) apeacock, (111) Euphorbus,
(iv) Homer, but by 'l'ertullian as
(i) Euphorbus, (ii) Pythagoras, (iii)
Homer, (iv) a peaeock. ln cither
case the joke implied 111 quintus is
the same. ‘awoke to find himself
No. 5 in the order of succession.'

pavone ex Pythagoreo] Sic enim
ait Ennius in Annalium suorum
principio, ubi se dicit vidisse in somnis
Homerum dicentem fitis-se se quondam
pavonem, et ex eo translatam esse
animam in se (schol.). Cf. also
Tertul. de A n. 33 Pavum se memi-
uz't Homerus Ennio somniante ,· sed
poetis nec vzgz'lantibus credam.

12 securus vulgi] sc. quid vulgus
dicat faciatque (Jahn). With zustlix
in the sense of ‘balefuL’ ‘blasting,’
cf. plumbeus A mter (Hor. Sat. Π.
6. 18) and Virg. Georg. Ι. 444
Α rhombusque satisque N otus pecorique
sinister ; and with praeparet, ‘may '
have in store for,' cf. Quid 'cogitet
humidus Auster (Georg. 1. 462).

13—17] ‘ Careless too of the fast
that my neighbour’s nook of land is
more productive than my own : aye
verssy, though all men of meancr
origin should grow rich before me,
yet would Ι steadily refuse to be ⁷
bent and dwarsed by discontent,
or to dine without a delicacy, or to
touch with my nose the seal on a
flagon of stale wine.'

13 angulus ifle] like Osi angulus
ille Proximus accedat qm· nunc deuor-
mal agellum (Hor. Sat. ΙΙ. 6. 8).

14 pinguior] Cf. Ov. A. A. 1.
349 thz'lior „vaejgfe's cst alienis sculpat·
ju. agris, W'Cuumque pecus 3v¹cltztl1'les
ulm· lmba‘.

etsi adeo omnes] not as Macleane,
‘absolutely all,' but ιΥο5, J rapsa!
jx, though all?

15 orti pejoribus] Cf. Hor. Ep.
Ι. 6. '22 lndzjgmmn quod sit pejoribus
ortus llic tibi sit potius quam tu
nub-abilis illi, while 111 the present
