Ore teres modico, pallentes radere mores 15
Doctus et ingenuo culpam defigere ludo.

Hine trahe quae dicas, mensasque relinque Mycenis

Cum capite et pedibus, plebeiaque prandia noris.—

Non equidem hoc studeo, bullatis ut mihi nugis

Pagina turgescat, dare pondus idonea fumo 3 20
Secreti loquimur: tibi nunc, hortante Camena,

Excutienda damus praecordia, quantaque nostrae

of daily life) Cs. togatae (fabulae)
and turba togata, gens togata of the
Roman citizens (Prop. lv. α. 56).

junctura] Cf. Sal. 1. 65, 923 and
Hor. Ars poet. 47, notum si cal-
lida verbnm Jeeddiclerit jimc'lura
novam.

15 pallentes] The effe& sor the
cause. Cf. Sat. IV. 47, and m'l conscire
sibi, nulla pallescere culpa (Hor. Ep.
1. ι. 61).

radere] Cf. Sat. 1. ποῖ, where the
word is used 111 a precisely similar
sense.

16 defigere] to ‘nail sast' like
a placard to a wall, and so to ‘ post
up' a fault (Casaub. ); an explanation
which Ι much prefer to that adopted
by Jahn and Heinrich, Ut dicitur
figere cervos, cz'czmas (Virg. Ecl. ΙΙ.
29, Georg. Ι. 308) jaculari, ita de-
figere est prorsus conficere.

17 dicas] The MSS are in favour
of (licis, but the lines which follow
show that it is the snly'ec'l that is
meant rather than the words in
which it is expressed.

relinque] in pursuanee of the in-
tention expressed in ver. 5 of the
l’rologue.

18 cum capite et pedibus] These
are specially mentioned because they
were reserved to convince Thyestes
of the real charaeter of the food he
had caten.

19] The answer of Persius ‘N o,
indeed, that is not my objeff'c: I've
no desire to swell my page with
frothy nothings fitted only to give
weight to smoke.'

bullatis nug-is] Herm.; pullatis
nugis, Jahn (after the Schol. who
notices the reading bullatis but adds
the wrong explanation ornatis, and
who probably for that reason pre-
ferred pullatis as the less ambiguous
word). But pullatis nugis, ‘black-
1⁴obed nonsense‚' propter lrz‘slessabn-
las, et quod nmm'noe pulla vesle, id
est lugubri, tragoedi utebantur, ap-
pears to me an extravagant expres-
sion and far less simple than bullatis
nugis, ‘frothy nothings,’ which is
moreover the reading of many MSS.
and of the old editions. In support
of pullatis Jahn quotes the following
passage from Quint. V. 10. 71 Νοη
possum praetextam sperare, cum exor-
dium pallum videam, but it is the
combination of the word with nugi.-
which really constitutes the inappre-
ln‘iatcncss of the expression.

20 pondus dare fumo] a prover-
bial expression. Cf. nugis adden·
pondus (Hor. Ep. Ι. ¹9· 4²)· So

firmum swidero is used of one who

selis useless or deceptivc goods as
in Mart. iv. 5. 7 lividere nec vallos
circum pallalt'afitmos.
