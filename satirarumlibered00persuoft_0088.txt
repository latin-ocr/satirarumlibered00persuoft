60 A. PERSII FLACCI

SATIRA V.

L. Annaeus Cornutus to whom this Satire is addressed was a native
of Leptis in Libya and, as his name denotes, a freedman of one os the
Annaei. This much we leam from Suidas‚ who however in his minor
details confounds him with a historian of the same name. Persius went to
him at the age of sixteen to be instructed in the Stoic philosophy and
afterwards, it appears, received him into his house (cf. Suet. Gram. 7;
Rhet. 6); leaving him at his death his libraiy and a large sum of money, o*
which the former only was accepted by Cornutus. Among other works (πολλὰ
φιλόσοφοί τε καὶ ῥητορικά) he wrote a dissertation on the Categories of Aris-
totle, and in all probability a treatise still extant on the nature of the gods (περὶ
τῆς τῶν θεῶν φύσεως). He it was who revised the Satires of Persius previous
to their publication by Caesius Bassus, and recommended the destruction
of his earlier compositions. He was himself banished by Nero (πρὸς τοῦ
Νέρωνος ἀναιρεθείς. Suidas, Κορνοῦτος·) whose anger he had excited by
telling him that his intended poem on the history of Rome would be too
long, and that no one would read it (cf. Dio Cass. LX11.29). His banish-
ment must have taken place aster the death of Persius, and is assigned by
Jerome to the year 68, the last of Nero's reign.

This address to Cornutus which occupies the first fifty lines of the poenis
has invested it with an appearance of reality‚ of which as a satire it is totally
devoid. As a matter of fact, it is a dissertation after the fashion of the
schools on the following dogma of the Stoics ὅτι μόνος ὁ σοφὸς ἐλεύθερος καὶ
πᾶς αἶ’φρων δοῦλος (the subject of Cicero’s fifth Paradox and of the seventh
Satire of Horace’s second book), and is conducted throughout with that
freedom srom all personality which at a glauce distinguishes the style os
our author from that of Lucilius, Juvenal or Horace. As a whole it is
unqucstionably the most perfect of the Satires and the best specimen of
the genius of Persius. It is more evenly sustaiued and more free from
abrupt transitions than Satire ΙΙΙ. and, although we may not bc able to
instance any one passage which rivals the famous description of the ‘ Ter-
rors of Remorse⁷ (Sat. 111. 30 —43)‚ there arc several os unusual power and
beauty (take for example vv. 52—72; 90——1003 132—152; 176—188);
while, as a specimen of that indefinite satire which exposes the individual
only as the representative of the class, the manumission scene (vv. 72—82)
is probably unrivalled.
