xvi INTRoDucTION.

A single glance is sufficient to discover the special
character of the above lines. » They are certainly no
parody on the original passage in Catullus (Carni. inv.
257); for, with the exception that they do not read
connectedly, the style of the original is hardly exaggerated‚
and the plagiarisms are too wholesale and direct to allow
of their being called an imitation. They are in fact a
richauffe' of the passage in question, words and phrases of
which have been so pieeed together that the original
connection is lost, a practice specially ascribed to Nero
and his friends by Tacitus (Ami. xrv. 16); ⁶ Carminum

the incapacity and immorality of his government. With-
out some theory of this kind the introduction of Alcibiades
into the Satire becomes in itself an affected and unin-

character of all others likely to have suggested itself as
the somewhat heroic counterpart of that of the reigning
emperor. The youth and inexperience (cf. vv. 4, 5), as
also the personal attractions (ver. 20), of Alcibiades were
to a great extent reproduced in Nero, who cameto the
throne before he was seventeen and was at that time
singularly handsome in appearance.

Above all, the discreditable actions alluded to in vv.
35, 36 are known facts in Nero's life, while, so far as
our information goes, they have no direct reference to
the life of Alcibiades. And the same remark applies
even more strongly to ver. 49,
