INTRODUCTION. xxi

unquestionably the most difficult, and that mainly from
the extreme brevity with which the several parts of the
subject are treated. It reads, in fact, like a parody
on the style of Persius, for in a short compass it ex-
emplifies all his worst faults in an exaggerated form.
In no other Satire, so far as I can discover, are the
transitions so abrupt: take for example VV. 37, 41, 52,
and in particular ver. 75 Vende animam lucro, which last
has so little apparent connection with the preceding
lines that, as Macleane well remarks, it is impossible
to account for its place in the Satire, except by the
theory of incompleteness. But more than this, the Satire
in its present form contains two unexplained references:
(i) the incidental allusion to tuus iste nepos (ver. 71) of
whom no previous mention had been made, and (ii) the
expression neu dicta repone paterna (ver. 66), where the
use of the verb reponere, to ‘retaliate,' implies a previous
injunction which is not found in the Satire as it has
come down to us, for ver. 25 Messe tenus propria vive
et granaria (sas est) Emole, the passage to which it is
commonly supposed to refer, is clearly from the context
a recommendation to liberali& rather than to economy.
When, in addition to the internal evidence, we consider
that this is at the same time the natural interpretation
of the biographer's statement, we may fairly I think
conclude that, in its present form, the Sixth is little more
than a skeleton Satire containing the heads of the sub-
ject as he had intended to work it out in detail, with
a completed passage thrown in on occasion as for in-
stance the description of the triumph (ver. 43—51).
If it was from this Satire that his friends suppressed the
unfinished parts (versus aliqui dempti, sc. lines hastily or
partially completed like many in the Aeneid) and thus
gave it a false appearance of completeness, the very
effe& would have been produced which gives to the
poem its distinctive character. Up to this point I
