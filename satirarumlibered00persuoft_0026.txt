xxii INTRODUCTION.

can entirely concur in the opinion expressed by Mac-
leane that the Satire in its present form is only a frag-
ment, but when he appends the marks of incompleteness
to the line ‘Inventus Chrysippe tui finitor acervi’ Ι be-
lieve he has committed an error of judgment, and that
he has marked as incomplete the only part of the Satire
which we may safely pronounce to have received the
finishing touch of the poet. Whatever alterations or
additions he might have intended to introduce into the

sound closes the subject with such admirable effect.

contain the climax, though no more than the climaX,
of a diatribe against Avarice, and that not one word
more could have been added to the subject or the
Satire‚ which is at once summed up and exhausted by
‘ Inventus Chrysippe tui finitor acervi.'

To attempt anything like a detailed account of the
authority and readings of all the MSS of Persius, no less
than sixty-seven of which have been quoted and de-
scribed by Jahn, would of course be beyond the scope
of the present edition. At the same time it may perhaps
be of use to the general reader, in cases where the
editors differ, to know what is the reading of the four
MSS which in point of authority stand alone at the
head of the list. In all such cases the readings append-
ed to the text are derived from Jahn's edition, as also
the descriptive notice given below of the character and
authority of each particular MS. I have added the
