sATIRA Ι. 15

Nugari solitos graece, nec ponere lucum 70
Artifices nec rus saturum laudare, ubi corbes

Et focus et porci et fumosa Palilia foeno,

Unde Remus. sulcoque terens dentalia, Quinti,

Quum trepida ante boves dictatorem induit uxor

Et tua aratra domurn lictor tulit—euge poeta! 75

late ‘Do but look,’ making modo
equivalent to νυν, not νῦν.

heroas sensus] κ’. e. attempting to
write an Epic poem before they
have mastered the Bucolic style, thus
reversing what Persius (perhaps on
the strength of Virgil's example)
considers to be the legitimate order
of composition. Cf. Dion. Cass.
LXII. 29 παρεσκευάζετο δὲ [ὁ Νέρων]
ὡς καὶ τοὶς τῶν Ῥωμαίων πράξεις ἁπά-
σας συγγράψων ἐν ἔπεσι.

70 nugari soiitos Graece] An
evident hit at Nero, whose earliest
effusions were all in Greek. Cf.
Philostr. (apud Apoll. Ῑῇἀπ. IV. 39)
Ἀναβαλλόμενος οὖν ὅπως εἰώθει καὶ
βραχὺν διεξελθὼν ὕμνον τοῦ Νέρωνος,
ἐπῆγε μέλη τά μὲν ἐξ Ὀρεστείας ταὶ
δὲ ἐξ Ἀντιγόνης, τὰ δὲ ὁπόθεν ’γοῦν
τῶν τραγῳδουμένων αὐτῷ. (Jahn.)
The Troica is the Epic alluded to
in the text, which was a distinct
poem apparently from the ἅλωσις
Ἰλίου said to have been sung when
Rome was burning.

ponere] ‘WVord—painting’ is the
idea. Cf. Hor. Od. lv. 8. 8 Sollers
nunc hominem ponere, nunc deum.

71] Then follows a quotation,
perhaps from one of Nero’s poems.
It commences apparently with the
word comes and ends with tulit.

72 Palilia] Also called Parilia

'⁸ by the interchange of l sor r, ef.

lilium (λείριον). It was celebrated
on the ‘zlst April, the anniversary

os the foundation of Rome. The
loci classici on the subjec't are Ov.
Fast. IV. 781, Tib. ΙΙ. 5. 89, Prop.
V. 5. 77 (Macl.), in particular Var-
ro, L. L. V. 3, Rzlz'lia, tam privata
quam publica sunt apud rusticos, ut
congel-Hs cum foeno stipulis zjgnem
maguum transiliant, llis Palilibus se
expiari credentes. The ceremony of
‘passing through the fire’ was per-
haps supposed to appease the evil
spirit by a pretended sacrifice.

73 Quinti] Cf. Livy, 111. 26.

74] ‘ When your wife in a flutter
of excitement invested you with the
dictatorship at the head of your oxen,
while your plough was carried home
by a lic‘tor! Bravo! poet.'

dictatorem] [inflaturam Orel.‚
Weber, ἃς. and most MSS.

difflatorem Jahn, Heinrich, and
the best Mss (Jahn). Hermann
says ‘vestem dictatoriam dicraturam
appellat etiam Plin. Nat. Hz'st.
xvim. 3. 203' but ‘invests with the
dz'c‘lzzlorslzip' would likewise be a le-
gitimate translation of difflaturam
l'am'ltil.

If dz'c‘latorem is read (and under
the circumstances we may accept
it as the best) it must be epexegeti-
cal ‘invested you so as for you to be
dicffators

76 Brisaei] Bm'saez's (Casaub.) as
the name of the book, but against
the authority of the Schol. and all
the Mss (MacL).
