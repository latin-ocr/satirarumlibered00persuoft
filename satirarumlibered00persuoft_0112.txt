ver. 170. nec trepidare γ.

164 rem frangam] Cf. Hor. Sat.
11. 3. 18 Postquam omnis ret mea
Janum A d medz'umfrac‘la est.

165 udas] ‘Udaefores vel undae
sunt unguentis (cf. Lucr. IV. 1 175 At
lacrumans exclusus amator limina
saepe Floribus et serlis operit, postes-
que superbas Unguit amaracino)
vel vino profuso humidae (cf. Plaut.
Cztrc. Ι. 1. 88 A gite, bibite fhstz'vae
soresl) vel lacrimis madidae (cf. Mart.
X. 13. 7 Ad mauram jaces fastosae
limina moechae, Et madet heu!
lacrymis janua surda tztl's.)⁷ Jahn.

For exstindla cum sace cf. Prop.
1. 16. 8 Semper et exclusi slg'na scc-
cere faces.

167 dis depellentibus] ἀποτρύ-
ποισι δαίμοσι (Aeseh. Pers. 203).
'l'hey were also called ἀλεξίκακοι,
ἀπωσίκακοι, Lat. averruncae, depul-
sores. Apollo and the Dioscuri
were among the (leities universally
recognised in this: char-aeter.

168] ‘But do ycm think, Davus,
she will bc sorry when l leave her!
You are joking, young master; you
will only be taken to task with her
red slipper. Don't you be sretting
yourself and chafing at the toils that
beset you, savage and furious sor
the moment, yet, if she were to call
you, ready enough ιι) cry l am
coming! ’

169 solea] Cf. Ter. Eme. v. 7. 4
Ulimzm cibi cannultzjqari videam
sandalio caput. Jahn and Macleane
appear to mc to lose the sine irony
ol‘ the passage when they regard

this a& as a serious insult which the
slave advises his master to avoid,
an explanation which is certainly not
borne out by the word nugaris.

170—173] These lines have been
variously arranged. I have myself
followed Jahn's punctuation as the
best proposed by any editor. It is
almost identical with that adopted
by Hermann, who however breaks
up the sentence uunecessarily when
he places a note oi exclamation after
casses, thus making diras indepen-
dent of the ne in the preceding line.
Mr Paley would be inclined to eon-
necst the entire passage still more
closely by removing the stop at
dicas and treating lmml mora as
little more than an adverb, ‘Don’t
be restless in the toils‚ and then, if
she calls you, say at once wlcal
must ld0?' It is hardly too much
to say that of all the possible modes
of punctuation Macleane has se—
lec‘terl the worst when he puts a
comma at rubra and a sull stop at
casses.

170 trepidare] A metaphor srom
a wild animal caught in the toils.
Cf. Prop. 11. 3. 49 Sic primojuvcms
lrrsz'dant in, amm‘efi‘rocae's.

172 arcessat] 'she Indicative is
the reading of the MSS, but, as
Jahn well says, apparet conj. cuni
