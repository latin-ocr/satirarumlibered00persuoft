INTRODUCTION.

ΙΤ is tne fashion to include Persius among the ⁰1³³⁵icalffssss¹555²ffi

authors of whom in stereotyped phrase ‘little or

with an authority which denotes an intimate acquaintance
with the events described and which it would be useless
for us at this date to question, while, as Macleane
remarks, the truth of his narrative is to a certain extent
