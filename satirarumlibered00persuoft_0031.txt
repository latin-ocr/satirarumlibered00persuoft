PROLOGUS.

ARGUMENT.

Ι lay no claim to inspiration, for Ι never drank from Hippocrene nor
dreamt upon Parnassus (1—3). All such pretensions Ι leave for poets of
established reputation. Ι am but little better than a country clown who
bring my offering to the poets⁷ store (4—7).' But as hunger can teaeh the
parrot and the pie to speak (8—11) so, if the hope of coining money shall
present itself, the parrots and pies of the poet world will make efforts that
may almost pass for the result of inspiration (ta—end).

Nec fonte labra prolui caballino,

Nec in bicipiti somniasse Parnasso
Memini, ut repente sic poeta prodirem.
Heliconiadasque pallidamque Pirenen

1. ‘I have not bathed my lips
in the sountain of the hack nor re-
member to have dreamed on two-
peaked Parnassus, to account for
my appearance in this new character
of poet.’ These were the legitimare
methods of securing inspiration: cf.
Prop. 111. 3. 5, and Cic. Acad. Pr.
11. 16. 51, as also for the dream of
Ennius which is again alluded to in
Sat.VI. 10.

fonte caballino] So gorgonei
caballi Juv. Sat. 111. 118, as hav-
ing been produced by the stroke of
Pegasus’ hoof. Of caballino the
Schol. says caballino aulem diest
non equina, eo quod Satt'rae lzumz'-
liora verba confingant, but the
poet is here purposely contemptuous‚
by way of implying, as he does
throughout the prologue, that there
are other agencies besides so-called
inspiration which may make a man
a very fair poet.

'2 bicipiti] Cf. soph. Ant.
1126 σὲ δ’ ὑπὲρ διλόφου πέτρας

στέροψ ὄπωπε λιγνύς, Ovid, silet. I.
316, and Herod. vm. 32. 39, who
speaks of the two peaks as Tithorea
and Hyampeia respectively.

3. sic] ‘just as Ι was' Macleane‚
but Ι cannot altogether acquiesce in
this rendering. In the passage he
cuotes from Soph. Ajax, v. 1206
κεῖμαι δ’ ἀμέριμνος οὕτως the mean-
ing of οὕτως is ‘ as 1 am: as you see
me,⁷ rather than ‘ as Ι was,’ and ἀμέ-
ριμνος is there introduced to define
οὕτως, ‘ uncared for even as you see
me.' So here trans. ‘In this cha-
racfter, I mean as a poet.’ And the
same explanation will suit in Horace,
Carm. 11. 1 1. 14, and Virg. AEn. 111.
667, while the accuinulation of ideas
conveyed in repenle and poeta makes
any other interpretation extremely
awkward in the present passage.

4. ‘ Your Heliconian maidens
and your pale Pirene Ι leave for
those around whose busts the cling-
ing ivy twines.⁷

pauidam Pirenen] Paleness was
