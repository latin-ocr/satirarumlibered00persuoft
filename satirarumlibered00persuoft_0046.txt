A. PERsn FLACCI

Ut ramale vetus praegrandi subere coctum ?—
Quidnam igitur tenerum et laxa cervice legendum?
Torva Mimalloneis implerunt cornua bombis,

Et raptum vitulo caput ablatura superbo

Bassaris et lyncem Maenas flexura corymbis
Evion i7zgeminat,· reparabilis adsonat echo?
Haec fierent, si testiculi vena ulla paterni
Viveret in nobis? summa delumbe saliva

97 praegrandi] Wgrandi Schol.,
and some MSS. Cf. Non. 183, 30,
and Cic. Agr. 11. 34. 93, Vegrandi
macie torridam, where however the
reading is doubtful, and on the
other hand cf. Ovid. Fast. 111. 445
sqq. The whole question of Ve in
compounds is thus adrnirably sum-
med up by Jahn: Ve significat id
vocabulum cui· praepositum est in
malam partem verti, quod cum vel
augendo vel minuendo fiat, filcile in-
tellzgatur quomodo id in utramque
partem dici possit.

98] ‘ You abuse the Aeneid, says
Persius, for its roughness: so give
me a specimen of poetry which I
can read without straining my
throat (laxa cervice), or shall I sug-
gest the following ‘3’ Perhaps laxa
comice may refer to the affe&ed atti-
tude of the reciter (cf. Lucr. Ι. 36).
Jahn regards spumosum et corlicepin-
gui as the censure of Persius on such
verses as 93-95, which ruins the
connection of the whole passage.

99—102] These lines, read as one
piece, form an admirable example
os what 1 understand by the junc'lura,
viz. a resetting os old verses. They
are a weak rechauffis of Cat. Carm.
wa. 257 sqq. Cf. Tac. Ann. xw. 16.
Carmimcm quoque studium [Nero]
affidavit, contradis quibus aliqua
pangendi facultas necdum insigms

Euhion Vat. Herm„ prob. Wagner orthograph. Verg. p.

erat. Hi cenati considere simul et
allatos vel ibidem repertos versus
conneetere atque ipsius verba quoquo
modo prolata supplere. Quod species
ipsa carminum docet non impetu et
instintftu nec uno ore fluens. Cf.
Sen. Nat. taaest. 1. 5. 6, and Schol.
ad Lucan. 3. 261 (ad vocem Tigrim),
for other verses by Nero of an ex-
ae‘tly similar type.

For these reasons I should print
lines 99—102 connedffidly, and not
as separate quotations.

99 Mimalloneis] is used like Bas-
saris of the Bacehantes, from Mimas,
a promontory in the mainland over
against Chios.

102 reparabilis] ‘reprodudtivess

103—106] The lines had been
quoted in irony: now follows the
serious criticism‚ ‘ would such verses
be eomposed if any trace of our
fathers’ manliness lived within our
veins? This emasculate stuff floats
in the froth upon our lips, and
Maenas and Attis run glibly enough.
This is not of the kind that beats the
desk or savours of the bitten nail?

105 in udo] Macleane well com-
pares λέγων ὅτι χαλεπὸν τῷ λάλῳ ἐστὶ
σιωπᾶν καὶ ὠς ἐν ὑγρῷ ἐστὶν ἠ ’γλῶττα
(Theophr.Clzar. VII.) of a chatterer's
srothv nothings.

107] Here the Satire virtually
closes, and a dialogue follows be-
