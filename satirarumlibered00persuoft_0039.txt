SATIRA I. 11

Hic aliquis, cui circa humeros hyacinthina laena est,
Rancidulum quiddam balba de nare locutus,

Phyllidas, Hypsspylas, vatum et plorabile si quid,

Felix? non levior cippus nunc imprimit ossa?
Laudant convivae ; nunc non e manibus illis,
Nunc non e tumulo fortunataque favilla

Nascentur violae ?—Rides‚ ait, et nimis uncis 40

tos (ver. 20), T rossulus (ver. 82),
Romule (ver. 87).

dia] An affected word, ‘Let us
hear (say the company) what his
charming verses are aboutst In other
words they call for a recitation from
some sav ⁷ourite author. Macleane
imagines them to be‘ discussing the
char atster of true poet ..y ’an employ-
ment far too serious for the occasion
and the company.

33—-35] ‘Reciting some stale
ditty with a nasal e'twang dxawls
out the tale of Phyllis or Hypsipyle
or any plaintive ditty of the poets,
and minces the w ’ords as though his
mouth were sore)

33, 35] These lines may be an imi-
tation of Hor. Sat. ΙΙ. 3. 274 Quid
cum balba seris annoso verba palato?
Jahn would refer rancidulum to
the affectation of the reciter. Cf.
Mart. vn. 34· 7.

34 Phyllidas] All these are no
doubt imitations (possibly impro-
vised cf. ver. 51) of the well-known
epistles of Ovid. In lines 98 sqq. we
find a similar imitation of Cann.
LXIV. os Catul. while ver. 70-—75
contain another parody of a similar
description. For the whole ques·
tion os these after dinner recitations
cf. Introd. to the Satires.

35 eliquat] sc. like wine filtering
through a strainer. Supplantat is
the Gk. ὑποσκελίζειν.

37 levior] in allusion to the in-
scription so common upon head·
5101165, sit tilii terra levis.

38 manibus] The. repeated use
of the word manes (manis, ‘good,’
cf. mane [tempus] and immanis) for
the ‘bodily remains’ of the dead,
the offer-ings of meat drink and
clothes which were habitually made
to them, as likewise to the Genius
or ‘second self‚' are all 50 many
striking proofs of the materialism
of the ancient world. Cs. sepulcra
diruta, nudati manes (Livy) ; Prop.
ΙΙ. 13. 32, accipiat manes parvula
testa meos, and especially Prop. IV.
El. 7, 111 which Cynthia is repre-
sented as appearing after death with
all the traces of the funeral-fire upon
her person.

40—44] ‘You are laughfflg, says
he, and are too sond by half of that
critical sneer. Can you find any
one who will say that he would not
be glad to have deserved the favour
of the people‚ glad to have uttered
words worthy of the cedar oil and
to be leaving behind him verses that
sear neither mackerel nor frankin-
cense‘!7

40 ait] the imaginary opponent
who took up the cudgels at ver. 24.

uncis naribus] Cf. ver. 118 sus-
pendere naso. Horat. Sat. Ι. 6. 5,
and again ΙΙ. 8. 64; Mart. Ι. 4. 6
Nasum rhinocerotis.
