SATIRA 1. 21

Iratum Eupolidem praegrandi cum sene palles,

Aspice et haee, si forte aliquid decmffius audis.

125

Inde vaporata leetor mihi ferveat aure:

Non hic, qui in crepidas Graiorum ludere gestit
Sordidus, et lusco qui possit dicere lusce,

Sese aliquem credens, Italo quod honore supinus

Fregerit heminas Arreti aedilis iniquas& s

(13

Nec qui abaco numeros et seeto in pulvere metas

Scit risisse vafer, multum gaudere paratus,
Si Cynico barbam petulans nonaria vellat.

ver. 125. aspice ad haec γ (var. lec.). ver. 126. unde 7, prob. Wagner.

poses‚ for he is not speaking now to
one of the class who admired Labeo.
afflate] ⁴ inspired by.'

124 praegrandi] ‘The greatest of
the three‚' and not in allusion to the
age of Aristophanes, for he was the
youngest of the three comedians, nor

to the bygone period in which he
lived, as Macleane. (Cf. Hor. Sat.
Ι. 4. 1.)

panes] the paleness which results
from studying thern.

125 decoctius] ‘something more
refined than usual ;’ a metaphor from
wine well boiled down. Cf. Virg.
Georg. 1. 295.

126 Inde] ⁶ Let my reader be one
of that class,' zle. able to appreciate
delicate satire, not one who can only
make a jest at the peculiarities of a
nation‚ or the infirmities of an indi-
vidual.

vaporata] lit. ‘steamed’ with the
vapour of warm vinegar, and so
‘cleansed‚' ‘refined’ (Jahn). Cf.
purgatas aures (Sat. V. 63), aurem
mordaci lotus aceto (Sat. V. 86).
The notion seems to have been that
the sumes of the vinegar (ὄξος) would
make the hearing sharp and quick
(ὀξεῖαν ἀκοήν). Cf. note on Sat. V. 5.
‘Warmed‚’ Macl., but the idea is
already contained inferveat.

1 27 crepidas] The national Greek
boot as opposed to the calceus.
Hence crepidatae like palliatae are

Roman tragedies with Greek plots.

128 possit] poscit Casaub. need-
lessly; for the subj- ‘possit’ gives an
opinion of the man, ‘ gestit' a fita
concerning him.

129] ‘ Because luxuriating in some
provincial office—say that of aedile
——he may have broken up unfair
measures at Aretium' (a place noted
for its pottery).

Italo] Contemptuously; it is only
a provincial not a city office that he
has held.

supinus] ‘lolling at his ease,’ ‘in
lazy state.' Th'e idea of pride is
secondary to that of laziness. So
probably in Mart. V. 8. 10, which
Macleane quotes in support os the
opposite view.

130 heminas] ὲ the sextarius,
sc. ‘ half-pint pots' for measures ge-
nerall .

131>]Ῑ ‘Not one who thinks him-
self a elever fellow because he can
ridicule the numbers on a counting-
board or the diagrams marked out
in the sand,’ tle. arithmetic and geo-
metry put for learning generally.
Cf. Aris. Nub. 177.

abaco] A tray with raised border
and wooden diwsions, used for
making calculations.

133 nonaria] because they were
not allowed abroad before the ninth
hour (SchoL). So vellunt tibi bar-
bam hzscivi pueri, Hor. Sat. Ι. 3. 133.
