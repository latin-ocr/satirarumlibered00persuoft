INTRODUCTION. xvii

the only satisfactory explanation of which is to be found
in the description of Nero's nightly rounds given in
Tae. Ann. xm. 25, and Suet. ,Νὲνο 26, the former of
which passages Ι quote in full: ‘ Quinto Volusio, P. Sci-

It is far more probable that he imitated Sophron the
Syracusan or some other early writer of mimes, in evi-

of proverbial or popular phrases, such as excutere aristas,
olla fervebit, &c., but more particularly the fact that the
abruptness of his transitions is almost entirely obviated
if the Satires are recited aloud and a change of voice
introduced to mark a change of character or scene.
That Persius drew largely upon Horace, not only for
his ideas but also for the language in which he clothed
them, is I imagine an accepted belief, and a glance
through the references to Horace contained in this or
any other edition of our author would suffice to prove
the fact. But when it is suggested (and Jahn appa-
