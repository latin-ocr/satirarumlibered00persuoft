A. PERSII FLACCI

Progenies terrae? Quaere ex me, quis mihi quartus
Sit pater: haud prompte, dicam tamen, adde etiam unum,
Unum etiam: terrae est iam filius, et mihi ritu

Manius hic generis prope maior avunculus exit. 60
Qui prior es, cur me in decursu lampada poscis?

beggars: cf. Dignus ad Α ricmum qui
mendicaret ad axem (Juv. IV. 117).
Virbius is identical with Hippolytus,
who was restored to life by the
agency of Diana, and worshipped
in company with her at Aricia under
this title. (Cf. Virg. Aen. VII. 771
sqq.‚ Ov. Fast. 111. 265, VI. 756.)

Manius] An ordinary name for
slaves and men of low birth, like
Dama, Davus, &a There is little
doubt that the proverb Multa· fisani
Ariciae (ap. Fest.) alludes to the
number of these vagabonds in the
neighbourhood of the Arician tem-
ple, and that the explanation of
Festus, multos claros viros ibiflzisse,
is either salse or refers to a different
period from the present.

57—60] ⁶ A son of cartlz! do you
say? Come ask me to tell you who
was my father four stages back. Ι
must think, but still I can tell y0u;
but add one to him, and now one
more, and I've got to a ‘Son of
Earth,’ and so by the law of descent
Manius proves to be something like
my great uncle.’

57 quartus pater] sc. abavus:
adde eliam unum (=atavus), unum
etiam (=t1·itavus). With the whole
of this passage cf. in particular
Plato, leeaet. 174113 τὰ δὲ δὴ ’γένη
ὑμνούντων, ὡς ’γενναΐὸς τις ἑπτὰ. πάπ-
πους πλουσίους ἔχων ἀποφῆναι, παν-
τάπασιν ἀμβλὺ καὶ ἐπὶ σμικρὸν ὁρών-
των ἡγεῖται τὸν ἔπαινον, ὑπὸ ἀπαιδευ-
σίας οὐ δυναμένων εἰς τὸ πᾶν ἀεὶ
βλέπειν, οὐδὲ λονγίζεσθαι, ὅτι πάππων
καὶ προγόνων μυριάδες ἑκάστῳ ’γεγό-
νασιν ἀναρίθμητοι, ἐν αἶς πλούσιοι
καὶ πτωχοὶ καὶ βασιλεῖς καὶ δοῦλοι

βάρβαροί τε καὶ Ἕλληνες πολλάκις
μυρίοι ’γεγόνασιν ὁτῳοῦν, ἀλλ’ ἐπὶ
πέντε καὶ εἴκοσι καταλόγῳ προγόνων
σεμνυνομένων καὶ ἀναφερόντων εἰς
Ἠρακλέα τὸν Ἀμφιτρύωνος ἄτοπα
αὐτῷ καταφαίνεται τῆς σμικρολογίας,
ὅτι δὲ ὁ ἀπ’ Ἀμφιτρύωνος εἰς τὸ ἄνω
πεντεκαιεικοστὸς τοιοῦτος ἦν, οἵα συν-
έβαινεν αὐτῷ τύχη, καὶ ὁ πεντηκοστὸς
ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ, ’γελᾷ οὗ δυναμένων λογί-
ζεσθαί τε καὶ χαυνότητα ἀνοήτου
ψυχῆς ἀπαλλάττειν.

59 terrae filius] is admirably ex-
plained by the following passage
from Tert. A pol. 10 Dic‘z'zts Saturnus
T errae Caeliquefilins, quia {gnoti vel
ex inopinato apparentes de caelo su-
pervenire (licuntur, sicut T errae filios
vulgus vocat, qnorum genus incertum
tul,- glgrmztcsque lzac ratione Terrae
silli appellandam Cf. also Cic. ad
Ast. 1. 13. 4, and Juv. IV 98 Unde
fit ut malim fraterculus esse gygantum.

ritu generis] can hardly be se'-
parated, though Jahn does so with
the remark ‘ ritu quod rite dici solet)

60 prope mai or avunculus] Major
avunculus is properly a brother of
the great-grandmother3 consequently
prope is added in the present case to
make the relationship less definite,
‘about on a par with!

61—66] ‘ Why do you who are
stationed ahead of me claim my
torch before 1 am out of the race?
I am a very god of luck to you: I
come to you in the very character
in which they represent him. Do you
decline my osser? Do you choose
to be satisfied with what is left?
There is something gone from the
capital, you say. Yes, and I've
