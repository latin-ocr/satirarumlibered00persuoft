42 A. PERsn FLACCI

Discere non sano multum laudanda magistro,

Quae pater adductis sudans audiret amicis.

Iure 3 etenim id summum, quid dexter senio ferret,

Scire erat in voto 3 damnosa canicula quantum

Raderet3 angustae collo non fallier orcae3 50
Neu quis callidior buxum torquere flagello.

46 Discere] So most Mss and edi-
tors; dicere Heinr. and Macl. On
internal evidence discere is prefer-
able, as it was the trouble of pre-
parz'ng the lesson which the boy
shirked.

47 pater audiret] So Juv. vn.
165 Quantum vis stzpulare et proti-
nus accipe qnod do Ut toties illum
pater audiat.

48—51] ‘And well I might: for
my highest ambition was to know
how much I should clear by a lucky
sice, how much the ruinous dog-
throw would sweep from me: how
to avoid missing the neck of the
narrow jar, how to become the cle-
verest hand at lashing the top with
the whip.’

48 jure] εἰκότως, in reference to
line 44. It has been badly referred
to sudans in the preceding line,
‘and well he might be anxious sor
my credit.’

senio] The game was played with
four tali, which, unlike the tesserae,
were rounded on two sides, while
the other four faces were marked
with one, three, four, or six pips,
and called respectively unic), ternio,
quaterm't), senio. The canis was the
worst throw when all four tali show-
ed single pips (cf. Ov. A. A. 11. 206,
Trist. 11.474, Mart. X111. 1. 6, Prop.
JV. 8. 46), and the Vanus the best
when all the faces turned up were
disserent (μηδενὸς ἀστραγάλου πεσόν-
τος ἴσῳ σχήματι, Luc. Amor. p. 415)
or else, for it varied upon occasion,
when all showed sices (τρὶς ἓξ βαλεῖν).
The ace was a losing throw and the
‘sice a winning oue when the pips

were counted (πλειστοβολίνδα παί-
ζειν); and it is to this form of· the
game that Persius apparently al-
ludes. (Jahn.) In Suet. 11. 71 we
find mention made of a round gme,
which was played with dice, though
in other respects it differed mate-
rially from the one here alluded to.

50 orcae] refers to a species of
‘cherry-throw‚’ thus described in
Pollux IX. 103 'H τρύπα καλουμένη
παιδιὰ ’γίγνεται μὲν ὡς τὸ πολὺ δι’
αἷστραγάλων, οὖς ἀφιέντες στοχάζον-
ται βόθρου τινὸς εἰς ὑποδοχὴν τῆς
τοιαύτης ῥίψεως ἐξεπίτηδες πεποιημέ-
νου, πολλάκις δὲ καὶ ἀκύλοις καὶ βα,-
λάνοις α’ντὶ τῶν ἀστραγάλων οἴ ῥιπ·
τοῦντες ἐχρῶντο. (Jahn.) Cs. also
Ov. anx, 85, 86 Vas quoque saepe
cavum ⁸spatia distante locatur, in quod
missa levi nux cadit una manu.

51 Neu quis] by a slight change
in the construction of the sentence
is made to depend direc‘fly upon
summum erat in voto.

52—59] ‘ But you are not without
experience in detersting crooked
moi-als, and know all the doctrines
of the wise portico frescoed with
breeched Medes, over which the
close-cropped disciples fed on beans
and coarse porridge pore the live—
long night, and the letter which
parts in two directions the Samian
branches has marked out for your
guidance the slope taken by the
right-hand path3 and yet you are
snoring at this time of day, and your
head, as loose as if it were un-
hingcd, is yawning off yesterday⁷s
debauch with your jaws at full
stretch!’
