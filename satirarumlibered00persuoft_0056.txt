A. PERSII rLAccr

Idcirco stolidam praebet tibi vellere barbam

Iuppiter? aut quidnam est, qua tumercede deorum

Emeris auriculas? pulmone et lactibus unctis? 30
Ecce avia aut metuens divum matertera cunis

Exemit puerum, frontemque atque uda labella

Infami digito et lustralibus ante salivis

Expiat‚ urentes oculos inhibere perita: ι

Tunc manibus quatit et spem macram supplice voto 35

28—30] ‘ Does it follow on that
account that Jupiter gives you leave
to twig his beard as though he were
a fool? or what pray do you possess
by the payment of which you have
bought the ear of the gods? is it
with lights, for instance, or greasy
chitterlings ?’

28 vellere barbam] Cf. 1. 133.

‘29 quidnam] al. quidquam. Qua
is used by attraction for quo.

30 lactibus] Ὑαλακτίδες. Like
viscera they denote the smaller in-
testines, while pulmo is here used
for exta, sc. the larger internal organs
of the body, as the heart, lungs, and
liver.

31-40] ‘See we have here a
grandmother or superstitious aunt
who has taken the boy out of his
cradle and, first of all, blesses his
sorehead and slobbering lips with the
middle finger and cleansing spittle,
for she is wise in the art of checking
the influence of the evil eye. Then
she dances him in her arms, and
with earnest prayer wafts her starve-
ling hope to the parks os Licinius,
the mansions os Crassus. May
kings and queens, she eries, com-t
him for a son-in-law s may tlze girls
scrmnblesor slim! ufirrc’cr lle trcads,
may reses grow! But J depute not
my prayers to a nurse: dcny her,
Jupiter, all she asks, although she
ask it clad 111 whitc.’
