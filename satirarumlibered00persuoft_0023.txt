INTRODUCTION. xix

‘ Multum et verae gloriae, quamvis uno libro, Persius
meruit‚' and Martial 1v. 29. 7.

Saepius in libro numeratur Persius uno
Quam levis in tota Marsus Amazonide.

But the height of his reputation was reserved for a later
age, when (as Jahn says) ‘ Praecipue scriptores Christiani
ob ethicam gravitatem et morum corrigendorum severi-
tatem Persium probarunt, neque erubuerunt eum sequi
non solum poetae, qui carminibus religionem Christianam
celebrarunt, ut Prudentius et Sedulius‚ sed patres etiam
ecclesiastici ut Lactantius...Augustinus...omnium autem

maxime Hieronymus'

It now only remains for me to consider the question The eco m-
of the completeness or incompleteness of the Satires in ξὲῗδῃ ziietres Μ
the form 1n which we have received them. It has arisen
in connection with a remark made by the biographer to
the following effect: ‘ Hunc ipsum librum imperfectum
reliquit. Versus aliqui dempti sunt ultimo libro, et quasi
finiturus esset leviter correxit Cornutus et Caesio Basso
petenti ut ipsi cederet tradidit edendum.'

On the strength of this statement two opposite theo-
ries have been founded τ

(i) By Macleane, who takes the words to mean that
our Sixth Satire is incomplete, and adds that line 75
‘begins a new branch of the subject, which is left un-
finished3'

(ii) By Jahn, who admits the incompleteness of the
Satires as a whole but regards the Sixth as complete in
its present form. His chief reason for this opinion is
the belief that this, the last Satire in our arrangement,
is really the earliest or one of the earliest of the series,
and on that account less likely to have been left in an
unfinished state than the first Satire, which on the con-
trary he would place very late in the order of compo-
sition chiefly on the strength of the allusions to Pedius
