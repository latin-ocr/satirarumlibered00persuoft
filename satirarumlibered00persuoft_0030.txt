2 A. PERSII FLACCI

as deprecatory in tone, and as forming an introduction to the first Satire
only, to which allusion is made in carmen nostrum v. 7. This explana-
tion, although far preferable to that proposed by Macleane, is I think open
to two objections, (α) that it suggests no motive for an exactly similar mis-
statement of fac‘ts in v. 9—11 of the first Satire, of which he offers the
following extremely lame interpretation ‘ Canities non de aetate intelligendum
est sed de corporis animique eorum statu qui omni luxuriae genere dissoluti
ante tempus senes fac'ti sunt ;' (β) that it is not borne out by the' con-
cluding lines of the Prologue, the translation of which has to be forced to
suit it.

(iii) Perhaps the following explanation will appear more probable:
that the first and fourth Satires are direct personal attacks on the character
of Nero, in which case the Prologue may reasonably be regarded as an
elaborate misrepresentation of fadis intended to divert public attention from
the real author of the Satires. That Persius and his friends had fears for
his safety may fairly be inferred from the dialogues introduced at the begin-
ning and end of the first Satire (v. 1—12 3 107—121), and the alteration of
reading in line 121 was in all probability necessitated by a similar cause.
So when we find the poet, who died before the age of thirty, talking os
his ‘ grey hairs, asceticism and advanced life,’ we are forced to look about
us for a theory which may suggest a motive for such deliberate misrepre-
sentation on the part of a man who had all the abhorrence of the Stoies
for a hhwhood.

Ι the above explanation be accepted it makes but little difference whe-
ther με adopt the opinion of Jahn, Passow, and Casaubon that these lines
are to be taken in connection with the first Satire only, or the one more
generally received which accepts thern as an introduction to the entire
body of the Satires. In either case I should not regard them as written by
way of sels-depreciation, but rather in justification of his powers: a view
which is borne out by the parallel passages at the beginning and the end of
the first Satire.

The metre is the scazon or choliambic‚ so called from the halting effect
produced by the introduction os the final spondee. For other examples cf.
Cat. Carm. 44, and Martial‚ Bk. V11. Ep. 26. 1, where the mctre is ad-
dressed by name Apollinarem convrm' “taum scazon.
