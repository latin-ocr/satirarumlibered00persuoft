SATIRA ΙΙΙ. 37

Inque manus chartae nodosaque venit arundo.

Tunc queritur, crassus calamo quod pendeat humor,
[Nigra quod infusa vanescat sepia lympha ;]

Dilutas queritur geminet quod fistula guttas,

Ο miser inque dies ultra miser, hucine rerum 15
Venimus? at cur non potius teneroque columbo

Et similis regum pueris papare minutum

ver. 12. querimur BI. Herm.; querimus Mp.; queritur Jahn, Mael.

Koenig.

ver. 16. palumbo Mp. 7. ; columbo B 1.
ver. 17.· pappare Herm.; ‘papan’ plerique codd. iique antiquissimi,'

Jahn

χρυσοῖ μὲν oz ὀμφαλοί, πορφυροῖ δὲ
ἔκτοσθεν η διφθέρα.

posius capillis] Cf. pumice lac-
vis (Ovid, Tn'st.111.1. 13), cm·
pumex tondeat ante comas (Tib. 111.
1. 10), also Mart. VIII. 72. 2, Cat.
1. 2.

12] ‘ His first complaint is that the
thick liquid clogs his pen: his next,
after diluting it, that the pen makes
two drops for every one.'

queritur] Qum-imur Herm.‚ but,
as Jahn well remarks, Pluralis mt-
meri tunc usus est uhi indzgrnabzm-
clus comes desidiosum juvenem allo-
quitur, non item ubi narrat de poeta.
In this case we have the scene de-
scribed by a third party, whereas
stertimus (ver. 3), however we ar-
range the lines, is the ironical com-
ment of some actor in the scene.

13, ¹4] These lines are remark-
able as affording, in all probability,
an example of the duplex rcc'nsio os
the Satires. They contain the same
idea repeated in a slightly different
form, and it is w eakened rather than
strengthenedby the repetition. Add
to which, the second querzlur is sin-
gularly out of place is all three lines
are retained and destroys the balance
of the passage. At the same time
the verses are so equal in point of
merit that it is more difficult to de

cide which of the tuo, the poet in-
tended to be finally retained, though
the artistic repetiti on of queritur is
almost decisive in savour of the
second. In confirmation of the above
view we find the precisely similar
line (ver. 75 os the present Satire)
omitted in one of the best *uss of
Persius.

It 1s w otth while comparing Soph.
T raclz 85, and again vv. 90, 91,
both of which passages are similar
examples of a διττολογὶα, where the
lines to be rejected are unquestion-
ably those which Dindorf has en-
closed in brael-ets.

13 sepia] That the juice of the

cuttle- fish was used for writing is
clear stom Auson. Ep. Iv. 76,x11.
54. The Schol. says that septa is
here used for atramentum as in
Pliny, xxxv. 6. 25 (cl. xxxvn. 7.
28), whose remarks however are
chiefly confined to painters' colours
( ahu).
J 16 Venimus] like stertimus in ver.
3, as here again the poet speaks in the
person os the professor. ‘Have we
reallx got to this pass? you should
be back' in the nursery again calling
sor minced pap, and refusing in a
pet mamma' s lullaby 2'

17 regum] as 1111 67.
