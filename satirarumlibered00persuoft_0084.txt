Ut nemo in sese temptat descendere, nemo,
Sed praecedenti spectatur mantica tergo!

Quaesieris: lVostz'n' Vettidi praedia ? Cuius?

Ν
Ut

Dives arat Curibus quantum non milvus oberrat.
Hunc ais, hune dis iratis Genioque sinistro,
Qui, quandoque iugum pertusa ad compita figit,

ver. 26. oberret Bx. Jahn, Macl. Koenig ς oberrat Mp. Herm.

23, 24] These lines are rightly
printed by Jahn and Macleane as pre-
facing a new paragraph and not as a
comment on what has gone before.
The miser Vettidius is introduced for
the purpose of exposing in strong
relies the opposite faults of Nero’s
character, and not merely (as Jahn
and Macleane imply) to illustrate a
dissertation on Γνῶθι σεαυτόν.

23 in seso descendere] a meta-
phor from the arena. To ‘enter
the lists against yourself’ is to do
battle with your own failings. This
explanation appears to me far pre-
ferable to that suggested by Mac-
leane to ‘go down into yourself as
into a dark mine or cavern.'

24 mantica] Two versions are
given of this fable, (i) and apparently
the original one in phaedr. 1v. 10,
that each man carries his neigh-
bour's vices in a wallet on his meast,
and is continually looking into it,
while his own he swings on his back
and never sees them; (ii) and
possibly the one adopted by Catul-
lus in Carm. XXI1.21, that each
man carries a double wallet on his
shoulders, in the front portion of
which his virtues are contained, in
the hinder his vices. Persius, ac-
cording to Jerome, has drawn his
illustration from the latter rather
than the former version. Cf. Hier.
Ep. 91 Nostram peram non valenles
aliorum, iuxta Persium, manticam
consideramus ἕ

25—32] ‘A friend may ask, You
know, don’t you, tlze estole of Vetti-
dius? What Vettidius? 7712 riclz
man who ploughs ol Cm‘cs more

land than tlte kite traverses in its
flzglzt. Is that the man you mean,
he who lies under the wrath of hea-
ven, who has made his very Genius
his enemy, who, whenever he hangs
up a yoke at the worn cross roads,
dreads even then to serape the old
seal from the tiny jar and sighs over
it Δία] heaven bless the deed! munch-
ing as he does so his onion and
salt; and, while the slaves are ex-
ulting over the replenished meal-jar‚
the master quaffs the mothery dregs
of vapid vinegar.’

‘z 5 Quaesieris] Quaesz'erit Mp.,
‘one may ask,' which I should my-
self prefer, as quaesieris and ais· may
wrongly be referred to the same
speaker. The question is a general
one⁷ addressed to the Roman Alci-
biades by a casual friend.

Vettidi] V'stz‘dii most of the MSS,
scanned Vestidgt'. But Jahn and
Herm. read Vettidi as the only form
found in inscriptions.

26 Curibus] The traditional birth-
place of Numa. The miser’s estate
is placed amongst the frugal Sabines,
that his parsimony may be all the
more clearly marked.

milvus oberrat] Herm.; oberret
Jahn. I prefer the indicative as better
in sense and inore analogous to
quantum milvi volant, the prover-
bial expression for large estates Cf.
Pctr. 37, and Juv. lx. 54 tot milvos
intra tna pascua lassos.

27 Genioque sinistro] Dis and
Genio are ablatives of quality. The
Genius delights in good living, and
is consequently enraged at the mi-
serly habits of its ‘second sels.v So
