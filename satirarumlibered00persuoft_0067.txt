SATIRA III.

Fingendus sine fine rota.

39

Sed rure paterno

Est tibi far modicum, purum et sine labe salinum— 25
Quid metuas?—cultrixque foci secura patella.

Hoc satis? an deceat pulmonem rumpere ventis,

Stemmate quod Tusco ramum millesime ducis,

Censoremve tuum vel quod trabeate salutas?

by placing himself under the guid-
ance of philosop hy, his position
would be unassailable by the Stoic
Professor.

purum] like concha salis puri,
Hor. Sat. 1. 3. 14, to show that the
family plate had been acquired by
fair and honest means.

salinum] The salteellar and the
paten reptes sent the small stocl· of
family plate. Cf. Hor. Carm.11. 16.
13 For the veneration in which these
were held as family heirlooms, cf.
Sanc‘tasfacitt's mensas salinorum ap-
positu (Arn. l. 2, p. 91) and Livy,
XXVI 36, who says they were speci-
ally exempted when the necessities
of the State called for a general
sacrifice of all other gold and silv er
plate (St. ).

26 Quid metuas] is the reflec‘tion
of a man whose independent posi-
tion enables him to defy the world,
‘why (you say) should you sear?’

cultrixque foci] Cf. Tib. 1. 10.
25, Ovid, Fast. 11. 633 Et libate
dapes ut, grati pignus honoris, Na-
trz'at incinctos missa patella Lares.
Patella was the word ordinarily used
in the Lares’ worship. It was sent
round the table before the meal was
commenced, and each guest placed
in it a portion os meat which was
offered to the Lares and then burnt
upon the hearth. Cf. also the Greek
proverb ἀφ’ Ἑστίας ἄρχεσθαι (Ari-
stoph. Vesp. 846), which there is lit-
tle reason· to doubt originated from
a similar usage.

secura] like laudes securum olus,
Hor. Sat. 11. 7. 30.

27—29] I can see no possible
ground for Jahn's supposition that

these three lines are addressed to
a different person from the last, for
the man who possessed no more than
a comfortable independence would
be the very person to pride himself
on his pedigree3 as, in saec, he has
already done in purum et stne labe
salznum. Besides this, tibi (ver. 52)
and stertis adhuc (ver. 58) are both
addressed to the pupil originally re-
ferred to in stertimus (ver. 3), and it
is his failings which form the subject
of the Satire.

²7 ventis] ‘with airs‚’ see note
on Sat. IV. 2ο.

28 stemmate] Cf. Juv. V111.1—6,
Suet. Nero, 37. These stemmata
were genealogical trees or tables of
pedigree‚ in which the fanu por-
traits (imagines) were comeeied by
winding lines, cf. stemmata vero li-
net}- discurrebant ad imagmes pz'c‘tas
(Plin. XXXV. 2), and multae stem-
matum flexurae (Sen. de Benef. 111.
28). These zwmagznes must be care-
fully distinguished from the cereae
zma3 ines or ancestral busts which
were display ed in the atrium, to
which m all probability they formed
an explanatory table as they are
mentioned 111 connection with (but as
distin& from) them in the passages
quoted above from Pliny and Seneca.

Tusco] Cf. Tyrrhena regum pro-
genies, quia T uscz prae caetm's nobili-
t ztt's antiquae⁴> ‹rloriam captabant Jahn,
who at the same time adds that the
poet may naturally be reverting in
thought to his native place.

millesime] ‘a thousand times re-
moved.'

29 censoremve tuum] Censorem
fatuum Macl„ a reading so weak
