6 PERSII FLACCI

SATIRA I.

THIS Satire contains an elaborate attack on the literary taste of the day,
and on Nero personally as the head and chief offender. The subject is
introduced by a line, presumedly his own, which Persius recites to 3 friendly
critic, who no sooner hears it than he attempts to dissuade him from
publishing (1—3). On this Persius expresses his contempt sor public
opinion (4—7)‚ his qualifications for writing and his consequent inability to
comply with his friend’s request (8—12). At this point he abruptly
breaks off and commences his attack upon the-poets of the day. All write
(he says) solely with 3 view to recitation (13—18) and popularity, however
gained, whether at the expense of morality or by success as a school—book
(19-30). He proceeds to exhibit the true character of all such applause,
which is bestowed indiscriminately on all authors who can afford to pur-
chase it (gr—55), on Nero for instance (56—75), and on poets who are
worthless or obsolete‚ as Labeo and Pacuvius (76—82). This desire.f0r
applause, he adds, is no less the bane of the law-courts (ὃὸ-92). Granted
that the poetry of the present day has lost some of the roughness which
characterized the earlier style, it has at the same time lost all its vigoux
and manliness (93—106). All this may be very true, you say, and yet
it may not be advisable to proclaim it to the world. well then I yield
to fate and say no more (107—1 14). Yet Lucilius and Horace were satirists
before my time. I must just whisper my secret to the pages of my book
and, what is more, call on all true lovers of satire to read and appreciateit
(115—end).

The following Satire should be earefully compared with the CXIV letter
of Seneca, in which the author treats of this depravity in literary taste and
regards it as a direct consequence os the morality of the age.

Quis leget haec ?-Min’ tu istud ais ? nemo hercule—Nemo?
