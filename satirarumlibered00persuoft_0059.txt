SATIRA ΙΙ. 31

Si tibi crateras argenti incusaque pingui
Auro dona feram, sudes et pectore laevo

Excutiat guttas laetari praetrepidum cor.

Hinc illud subiit, auro sacras quod ovato 55
Perducis facies 3 nam fratres inter aenos

Somnia pituita qui purgatissima mittunt

Praecipui sunto sitque illis aurea barba.

Aurum vasa Numae Saturniaque impulit aera,

ver. 54. excutias Bi. Herm. Jahn3 excutiat Mp. Macl. Koenig; excutiet γ.

ver. 59. expulit γ.

111. 105 Quum spes amellae juvenum,
exultantiaque haurit Corda pavor
pulsans.

Jahn, on the other hand, explains
putore laevo by Sz' mens non loeva
fuisset, and thinks that by guttas are
meant ‘tears.’

praetrepidum] Cf. 1. 74.

55—63] ‘ Hence has arisen your
custom of overlaying the faces of
the gods with triumphal gold, for
(say you) let those of the bronze
brethren who send us the dreams
least clouded with phlegm rank be-
fore the rest, and let them have the
honour of a golden beard. Gold has
already supplanted the vessels of
Numa’s time and the bronze of the
Saturnian age, and is working its
changes upon the urns of the vestals
and theTuscan earthenware. O souls
bowed down to earth and void of
heavenly aspirations: what does it
profit us to introduce our own habits
into our temples and to estimate
what the gods approve by the stand-
ard of this our sinful flesh?'

55 ovato] sc. with bracteae, form-
ed from the gold taken in war.

56 fratres aenos] The Gods in
general. So Jahn, who quotes the
following passage from Varro, R. R.
1. 1 Neque tamen eos urbanos [Deos
i nvocabo], quorum imqgines ad sorum
auratae stant (sex mares et feminae
totidem), quique fere omnes somniis
ec naam-nis visibm homines monere

credebantur. The other explanations
offered are (i) that of the Schol.,
who understands it to mean the fifty
sons of Aegyptus, whose statues, ae-
cording to Acron, stood in the por-
tico of the temple of the Palatine
Apollo, over against those of the
fifty Danaides. (Cf. Prop. ΙΙ. 3ῐ. 1
sqq„ Ov. Trist. 111. 1. 59 sqq.). But,
as Jahn remarks, qusquam Aegyp-
tiadarum mentionem faciunt scrip-
tores...p0rr0 cur A egypti filiis statuae
equestres ponerentur nulla quantum
video causa inveniri potest ‚⁰ (ii) that
it is the statues of the Dioscuri
which are meant. But they are
always represented in the character
of youths, so that the mention of the
‘golden beard’ would be inappli-
cable to them.

57 pituita purgatissima] sc. clear-
sighted and truthful. That pituita
was supposed to mark aheavy, cloudy
intellect is clear from the meaning
of the opposite expression emunctae
narzs.

59 vasa. Numae] sacrificial ves-
sels, amongst which are mentioned
capedines (Cic. Parati. Ι. 2. 11) and
simpuvia; cf. Juv. VI. 343 Aut quts
Simpuvium ridere Numae nzg'rumque
catinum ?

Saturnia aera] Jahn refers this
to the earliest coinage, which was of
brass and stamped on one side with
the die of a ship in honour of Sa.
turn’s arrival in Italy. But I should
