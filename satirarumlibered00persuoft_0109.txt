SATIRA V. 81

Ocius ad navem! nihil obstat, quin trabe vasta

Aegaeum rapias, nisi sollers Luxuria ante
Seduetum moneat: Quo deinde, insane, ruis? quo?
Quid tibi vis? calido sub pectore mascula bilis

Intumuit, quam non extinxerit urna cicutae.

145

Tun' mare transilias? tibi torta cannabe fulto

Coena sit in transtro, Veientanumque rubellum

ver. ¹⁴5· quod non 7.

Cf. Hor. Sat. 1. 6. 109 Pueri lma-
num portantes oenophorumque.

succinctus] εὐσταλής, altius ac
nospraecinc‘lis (Hor. Sat. ῐ. 5. 5).

141 Ocius ad navem] ⁶ Now we
are off to the ship 1’ It is strange to
see how great a difficulty has been
raised over the assignment of these
words. Macleane says, ‘ This seems
to be the poet's exclamation as the
man hesitates :’ Jahn, ‘It is the man
speaking to his slaves :² Heinrich,
‘ Itis a sailor singing out to them
to come on board.' Ι believe it is
no more than the poet’s life-like de-
scription of an imaginary scene.

vasta] Both Jahn and Hermann
wisely reject the reading vastum.
It adds nothing to the picture, while
the avarice of the man is cleverly
suggested in the size of his ship.

14² rapias] ‘nothing prevents you
from scouring the Aegean in a big
ship.’ Cf. Nonne vides quum prae-
cipiti certamine campum Corripuere
(Virg. Georg. 111. 103), because any
rapid motion appears to devour space
ζ viam vorare, ἁρπάζειν τὴν ὀδόν).

sollers] ‘artsuh' ‘ingenious‚' in
the excuses it invents for idleness.
For seductum cf. Sat. 11. 4; and for
deinde (which is here equivalent to
tandem) cs. Virg. Aen. V. 741 Quo
demde ruis :⁹

144 mascula] sc. robusta, Jahn.
Bile was supposed to denote mad-
ness (cf. the Gk. μελαγχολᾶν, and
Sen. Ep. xciv. 17 Bilis nigra
curanda est et in ipsa ficrortir cansa

t>ERS.

removenda), for which cicuta was
the ordinary remedy (cf. note on
Sat. Ι. 51, and Hor. Ep. 11. 2. 53
Quae poterunt unquam satis expur-
gare cicutae). On the subje& of cicuta
Koenig remarks ‘Cicutam a Latinis
vocari quamlibet cannam z'ntzcs cavam
et inanem, et liae laco που κώνειον esse
intelligendum sed latlzyridem‚ bilem
et pituitam purgantem, docet Salma-
sius?

146] ‘Are you the man to cross
the seas and to take your dinner on
a rower's bench, seated on a coil oi
rope?' i.e. with a coil of rope for
your seat. I have little doubt
that this is the right interpretation,
for it is difficult to believe that torta
cannabe fulto can mean to ‘sleep in
a hammoek' as Heinrich imagines,
or that such a stress is to be laid on
the word coena as Casaubon's trans-
lation would necessitate, ‘ Are you
the man to sit on acoil of rope while
your dinner is served on a rower's
bench? There remains however a
possible and not improbable interpre-
tation which refers fulto to transtro,
‘a broken bench propped on a coil
of rope.’ Mr Paley, Ι find, would
accept Casaubon's explanation.

147 rubellum] The diminutive
denotes contempt. It was naturally
a poor wine (cf. Veientani bibitur faex
crassa rubelli Mart. 1. 104. 9; 11.
53. 43 111. 49) and is here made
worse as the rosin was stale (vapida)
with which the inside of the jar was
coated; cf. Resinata bibis vina, Fa-
