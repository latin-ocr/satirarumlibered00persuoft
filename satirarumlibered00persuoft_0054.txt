Bile tumet.

Nerio iam tertia ducitur uxor !—

Haec sancte ut poscas, Tiberino in* gurgite mergis 15
Mane caput bis terque et noc‘tem flumine purgas.

Heus age, responde—minimum est quod scire laboro—

De Iove quid sentis? estne ut praeponere cures
Hunc—“cuinam?'' cuinam? vis Staio? an seilicet haeres?
Quis potior iudeX, puerisve quis aptior orbis? 20

Cz'st. 1. -3, 41, Curc. IV. 4. 29.

14 ducitur] conditur Herm. (after
the oldest MSS), which Jahn rejeots
with the following remark : ex inter-
pretatione v. ducitur, ut habet Serv.
ad Virg. Georg. IV. 256, probavit
Heins. ad Ovid. Metam. XIV. 746.
Accordingly, on the strength of his
authority, I have admitted ducitur,
which is the preferable reading on
internal grounds, as it renders the
satire less dire& and more in keep-
ing with the rest of the passage. At
the same time Herm. well quotes
Mart. v. 37 in support of condzb‘ur,
and Γυναῖκα θάπτειν κρεῖττον ἐστιν ἢ
’γαμεῖν (Cheroem. apud Stob. Serm.
LXVIII. 22) and the MS authority is
decidedly iu favour of his reading.

15, 16] Cf. Aesch. Pers. 201 Ἐπεί
δ’ ἀνέστην καὶ χεροῖν καλλιρρόου
Ἕψαυσα πηγῆςς Prop. ΙΙΙ. 10. 13
Ac primum pura somnum tibi discute
lympha; Ovid. Fast. IV. 655 Bis
caput intonsum fontana spargitur
unda. This ceremony was closely
allied to that of telling the dream
to the rising sun; cf. Eur. Jplc. in
Taur. 41 ἃ, καινὰ δ’ ἥκει νὺξ φέρουσα
φάσματα λέξω πρὸς αἰθέρ’ εἴ τι δὴ
τόδ’ ἔστ’ ἄκος, Soph. Elec. 424 ἡνίχ’
Ἡλίῳ δείκνυσι τοῦναρ, and again
ver. 635.

16 purgas] Herm. writes a note
of interrogation after this word,
which weakens the force of the

satire.

17—25] The obje& of the ques-
tion which follows is to convitst the
man of impiety out of his own
mouth. The proos is commenced in
his refusal to decide the point until
he hears the name of the other claim-
ant: strengthened by his hesitation
even after he has heard that Staius,
a notorious offender, is the alterna-
tive: completed by the supposed
horror of Staius on hearing himself
addressed in the language ordinarily
used in prayer. ¹ Come now answer
me a question; it is the veriest trifle
that I desire to know: what is your
opinion of Jupiter? would you be
inclined to give him the preference
over—whom? Do you ask whom?
Shall we say Staius? Can it be
possible that you hesitate? Which
of the two, think you, would make
the abler judge, the better guardian
of an orphaned family? Come then
suggest to Staius this prayer with
which you are trying to quicken the
ear of Jupiter, and he will exclaim,
T 00 bad by Jupiter! good Jupi-
ter! and will not Jupiter himself
exclaim, Teo bad! by mine own
sels? Do you fancy he has par-
doned you because in the thunder-
storm it is the oak that is shattered
by the sacred bolt and not you and
your house?
